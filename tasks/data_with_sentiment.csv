I try my best to help, tell her mostly the truth and sometimes the things I think she needs to here, and I know it’s not great, but I’ve never been through this myself and I don’t know anyone else who has. I feel the best I can do is put a tiny bandaid on the cut that is that nights breakdown. 

I get existential questions that I am nowhere near qualified to answer, watch as she struggles with sexuality on top of everything, hear about the occasional self harm, hearing about her ex-girlfriend.

1jjl4m5,2025-03-25T15:48:59,"Craving for my younger years

I’m currently 27, mentally probably a few years younger than that. While 27 is still very young, the world has already shoved you with responsibilities that you’re still trying to grasp. Sometimes you feel confident that you got them, but sometimes, you just want to run to your parents desperately afraid of making a mistake that may cost you a great deal. My 20s have been tough with a whole lot of life quakes I am not prepared for. Maybe my MDD, anxiety disorder and C-PTSD could be amplifying it, but big stressors nonetheless. I don't enjoy all the painful struggles, but maybe I took the moments in between for granted when I looked at the bigger picture. Underneath all the struggle, I had moments of joy, quiet, and success that my mind drowned out in favor of all the chaos. My mind can’t stop being hyper-vigilant because of all the stress.

I impulsively went out today because I wanted to take my mind off the decision to finally leave my job. I decided to go to a store so I could buy my friends at work goodbye presents for when I leave, and then I felt a sense of “warm sadness” seeing all the little toys and trinkets- Barbie, Carebears, Disney, Sanrio, Harry Potter, among other things that reminded me of my childhood. Suddenly, I was reminiscing on my “baby years”. I didn't have the easiest childhood, but my god I miss how much simpler everything was. Despite the difficulties, my imagination made me feel unstoppable. I miss being a 9-year-old with her Pokemon and I miss being a 15-year-old with her daily film binge-watching. But then, sometimes I don’t understand why I long for my younger years when I was struggling  back then.

As I entered my late 20s, I found myself longing for my early and mid-20s as well. While more cynical, I still held on to hope of better days. Landing my first job, traveling the world, going out with my friends often, getting the butterflies with romantic connections, dinners with my family, among other pleasures. Of course, these pleasures still exist today in my life, but I have grown much more afraid. The last few months showed me how fragile everything is. Anything and anyone you love can disappear without warning. Everything becomes a matter of survival. We have to do what we can to get by and it is a privilege to actually be able to do the things you want. At this point, we all want stability, peace, to be loved and cared for, to be healthy, and to be able to wake up the next day hoping that it’s a good day much more than we ever did.

TW: Vent, Violent speech, etc

So like, I know there’s something wrong with me. I do it’s beyond obvious that I am not normal no matter how hard I want to be. 

I think it’s Schizoaffective but this sounds similar but different to it. My psychiatrist won’t diagnose me, I stopped going to therapy almost 3 years ago now.
But it’s getting so bad.
I recently just turned 18, and these symptoms whatever you call them; experiences that I you know experience have just gotten worse and worse and worse.

I don’t know why they won’t evaluate me or diagnose me but there’s something wrong it’s so obvious.
The lip biting, hitting my legs and head full force with my hands in a fist, scratching and digging at my neck till there’s blood and wounds. 

This isn’t normal person behavior. 

The vocal and slight visual hallucinations, the delusions and paranoia, the extreme anxiety and severe depression and the feeling that my brain isn’t really in my skull is so, I don’t know.

And nobody gets it nobody has ever gotten it around me.

My mother doesn’t know what to do when it gets bad enough I go into a full psychotic breakdown where I cry and throw up and lose all momentum in my body, can’t stand can’t move I just lay there choking on my own vomit.

I’m not normal.

I know nobody likes me they all hate me I see the way they look at me they act like they don’t know but I see it I know it.

The disgruntled contempt looks of disgust and hate in their micro-expressions. I know everyone hates me it’s so obvious and it ticks me off I’ve never been liked I don’t know what I do wrong is it cause I’m ugly or is it cause I act weird or people don’t like me at all is it something about me WHAT is so wrong with me that you hate me so much is it cause I complain too much or is because I’m so sad and I don’t know broken or whatever I don’t know.

I’ve always been met with those looks is it because I dress like a whore or wear heels and bangles and necklaces am I too much or something? It bothers me so much I don’t even want to go outside anymore.

And god these voices in my head their like all differently personalities and stuff and their so fucking loud it’s I just want to break into my skull or something. I need help and I have asked for help my ENTIRE life and people keep filling me with these fake promises and white lies saying that they’ll help me that they’ll they’ll like fix me make me better make it to where I’m not so weak and scared and angry and sad all the damn time.

But they never do, they never help me. And the time passes and passes and passes and I get worse waiting for them to do what they say to engage with me to save me to make me better but they never do.

I’m so tired. What’s wrong with me?

I hope it's okay with the mods here, but I've set up a community for just that. r/apallagi is a great space for handling the legal and logistical end of avoiding conscription, but this sub aims to help people in a broader sense. For those who want to go down the i5 route, we will post threads and resources for just that. If anyone wants to explore conscientious objection, or any unique methods, we aim to discuss that too.

While we're focused on Greece and the conscription system here, people who want support avoiding the draft in other countries are welcome here as well, and we take posts in multiple languages.

Anyway, I've made a little explainer there so far, and a quick thread discussing the sub and what it aims to do.

I want to just get this out there. If anyone here is from Greece and finds themself in that position, consider checking it out, or sending me a DM if you're more comfortable. If you know anyone in that position, with even the slightest doubt about going, let them know. Even for those who aren't Greek, feel free to check it out and ask for support here.

I'm close with all three of them, and from what I know, even when her boyfriend asked about it she would always say nothing was wrong, even though he KNEW something was. The same thing happened with me and her best friend, but to a lesser degree.

**The situation**  
A month ago, it was like she hit a breaking point. She reduced contact with me and her best friend, and broke up with her boyfriend. From what everyone is telling me (including her and the boyfriend) the boyfriend did absolutely nothing wrong, far from it, they had a great relationship. But her mental state got so bad that she kept being overwhelmed and shutting down so she couldn't support a relationship like that. They both want to get back together, and the boyfriend is understandably devastated, but they're trying to be friends and hopefully get back together once her mental state is better, so maybe it's a break?

Even though she can't afford therapy, she's been working on things and is very slowly improving, but she seems to be pushing everyone away. I need some input on the situation and would be happy to answer questions because I really want her to be okay, and to be honest it's really unfair to the boyfriend. We're all confused as to what to do and how to help her especially because she hasn't explained fully what's going on, just that it's mental health stuff.

Ok I have a weird problem, and it's not really that serious, but I just want to discuss it....
I enjoyed boys love really much since middle school. Not that I fetishized it, I just liked to read about it, even platonic stuff. I like yuri too, I don't see much difference, as they say love is love, lmao. But I preferred yaoi a bit more since my main fandom was chinese historical/fantasy media. Also I'm still not sure about my orientation, I can't say that I love people in general. 
About a year ago, I caught a panic attack when I was reading something and cried for a long time. I don't remember exactly what triggered me so much, perhaps my condition was bad in general. Friends have long suspected that I have depression, but I can't get my lazy ass up and visit a doctor and in general my problems aren't that bad and I can live with them. For a year I felt terrible, inexplicable anxiety when I touched any queer media. It cost me a lot of effort, but to a greater extent, I almost overcame this irrational fear, but it did not go away completely. I still love queer dynamics much more than straight, but it is as if I had lost the feelings I had about it before. Sometimes I try so desperately to turn that feelings on that it causes physical pain. This is where a vicious circle begins: I want to read something, I don't feel anything, I try to rationalize it and find the reason why, I think about whether I need it at all and whether the suffering is worth it, I get anxious. Again and again.
Straight media doesn't give me the same emotions, but, since this is the norm in society and everything is ""straight by default"", at least I don't feel anxious.
I really want to return to my fandom, to the stories I wrote, to the fanfiction I loved to read, but I can't and I don't understand why. I lost all the things that gave me at least some dopamine and this was the last one. 
Maybe I need a break? Or this is how becoming an adult feels (I'm 21)? Or I need to learn how to enjoy straight things now? I can't even understand what I like and what I don't. If I start therapy, is there a chance that my interests will return? As for other things I enjoyed, such as drawing, I don't feel the same anxiety. I can still do it, I just became much more indifferent to it and I have much less creativity now.
Thoughts about this problem and the feeling of losing something important haunt me all day and make my mood much worse.

1jjho31,2025-03-25T13:00:40,"a cryout for help
Pardon me for my english as it‘s my third language and my brain fog doesn‘t help either..

I‘m a 23 year old male, living with my parents, no girlfriend.

So I‘ve been working at a not so new anymore job since 6 months, starting my 7th month in april. From the beginning I was - for the first time in my life - very enthusiastic for a new job and gave 100% from the start. I think, this is where the problems come from. I think I‘ve set unrealistic expectations upon myself.

The beginning was - for me - very stressful and I feel like we moved at a way too fast pace. I couldn‘t and still can‘t follow what I‘m even doing to 100% and it just gets worse day by day. I have trouble understanding anything at work (and even in private life) and I do so much mistakes and I‘m at a point where this should come to an end and I can’t afford do these easy mistakes anymore because - as I said - I‘ve been working here since 6 months now. Furthermore my coworkers stressed me out a lot in the beginning especially one guy and that‘s why I tried to learn everything way too fast and crashed. I‘ve been experiencing confusion, extreme stress, headaches, sometime nausea but the worst of all is extreme brain fog. I can‘t comprehend simple things anymore, I can‘t decide simple things anymore, I can‘t play scenarios through my head anymore, I forget EVERYTHING and even things I‘ve already learned at work. I meditate daily since a year but it doesn‘t help at all. I go to sleep anxious about work, I wake up anxious and I work anxious. Fridays I think about mondays and the last straw was yesterday when I took like 7 hours for something that should have taken 2-3 hours because I tried to understand it and I couldn‘t. So today was the first day I called off sick at work and I have no clue what to do. I have an appointment tomorrow to get a sick note and I have an appointment in a month at a psychiastrist which I‘m not very optimistic about tbh.

So my question is what should I do? I‘ve been so mentally exhausted and overstimulated I can‘t even think straight or decide as I already mentioned my brain is all over the place. I‘ve been contemplating to just leave everything behind and start a new life somewhere else in another country because my millenial parents have no sympathy for people with mental health issue people as myself, even though they saw me going through psychosis last year. Should I call off work 100% until they fire me or should I call off work 100% for a couple of days/weeks and then start working like 40% and increase it? Should I look for a new job already? I have 20‘000$ saved up in the bank but that won‘t survive for a long time. I‘m also thinking of leaving the house because I rather have no one who listens to me than my family who doesn‘t understand me and deny my feelings and portray me as weak.

Thanks in advance for any advice. Questions are much appreciated.

 I don't post about these things ever but lately as I approach 30 i feel a greater dread than ever about being alone. 
I've always been a very extroverted person which I found odd as I've struggled with minor to severe mental health issues since I was 9. I've always kept a tight circle of friends and then varying other social circles of acquaintances from down at the bars or other social outings but lately it feels like everyone is drifting away en mass. 

I haven't been in a serious relationship in quite some time and as my friends get married naturally I hear from them less. Part of me fears relationships greatly because I don't think I've ever been understood by a gf ever. I've tried being social in discords and stuff something I've never done but it feels cliquey and drama filled. My relationships with family, my closest friends, and God just feel so hollow and frayed and I've never quite felt this alone in my life even though I've made positive progressions in my life. 

Life feels completely meaningless when so much of my time outside of work is spent alone just waiting for the chance to spend it with someone I care about or for a friend to call or want to go out for a drink. I feel so unimportant to everyone I love and I feel like it will only get worse with age and it's led to some troubling thoughts I haven't had since I was a much younger man.

When I was younger I used to break down frequently, but these days I rarely cry. Recently, I came home and had a severe breakdown at 2 am because a resident indirectly called me a triggering word. My sister was angry at me, which is understandable considering I was disturbing everyone's sleep.

While my mom was talking to me to calm me down, I did indirectly mention relapsing and thoughts of wanting to die. She told me to consider going to a mental hospital for a while once my semester was over to receive some help, especially because I refused therapy (I've tried multiple times, but every time I go, they push medication even though I'm against it).

This is the reason I don't say anything anymore. Each time it is always ""maybe you should go away for a while"" or something like that.

I sleep on a couch because if I sleep in his bed I have to deal with him needing to touch me while he drifts off. Dinner had better be made by the time he gets home, he prefers nuking his food instead of freshly prepared. But it better be freshly prepared. I'm a great cook but I get told my food is equivalent to Alpo when he is irritated (not with me but over the world pissing him off). I have to ""kiss the ring"" and his ass on a constant basis. I'm OCD about cleaning. His place is clean all the time. I even wash dishes while I cook. I don't do anything half assed because I don't know how to. 

Yes, he took me in
Yes, there's food
Yes, he buys my needs if he feels I actually need them. However, I'm not on meds nor have I seen a psych since January 2024. He doesn't think I need meds. Any clothes he buys me are what he wants me to wear and then he bitches about what was spent. I can't even get my hair cut because he prefers women have long hair. My hair is limp and fine, long is not a good look. 

No, I'm not allowed my own friends. If I want friends I can choose from his. BTW, I'm 49F and he and his friends are 60+. 
No, I'm not allowed to leave here without him. 
No, I'm not allowed any company

He tells me I'm fat (he's 5'10 250lbs). 

I can't just walk away either. He's let me know that he will find me. He doesn't hit me so as far as he's concerned none of this is abusive. ""I've never hit a woman"" he doesn't get that words and actions can be so much worse. My first marriage was abusive ×5. Cuts, bruises and broken bones heal, my mentality doesn't just heal. 

He bad mouths my son and I have 2 biracial grandkids and he uses the n word constantly.

1jjehb4,2025-03-25T09:16:48,"Scared that I am wrong.
Hello, I F(17), feel like I am going insane. I am not asking for any diagnoses or anything, I just really wish I knew why the reason I am feeling this way. I would just like to vent here because I don't really know who else to go to.

I have been desperately asking for professional help by my parents since I was around 13 years old, I have been feeling this way since I was 10. I have never really had a bad family life, I have had anything super duper traumatic happen to me, and I do not really know if any of my immediate family have or had any mental health related problems. Despite all of this, I feel so depressed, my mood-swings are insane, I am so terrified of abandonment, I have never really had a good sense of self-esteem or self image, I just feel so hopeless all of the time, and I constantly have this gnawing feeling in my chest. My heart just feels so heavy.

Like I previously said I have asked for help, MULTIPLE times. My parents have just always said that it is due to my hormones and I am a teenager, I feel that the way I have been feeling and acting can not just be because of that. I am aware it is most likely playing a part in it, but it has to be more than that, right? I obviously do not wish to have any mental disorder but I really hope that it is because of it, I would be so embarrassed and ashamed that my parents are right and I am just lazy and being over-dramatic. 

My parents have seen the immense self harm I have done to my body many times. They've seen how unlivable and disgusting my room has gotten. They've seen the neglect of myself, homework, chores, grades, and relationships. The drug abuse, the isolation, my thoughts. I have told them over and over again how depressed I am and how I suicidal I feel, but they never believe me. 

I just simply wish my parents would believe me and tell me that they do. I want their approval more than anything. I want them to actually listen. My mom just always guilt trips me and brings up how supportive and loving my household is, which I know it is and it just continuously makes me feel even worse because why am I feeling this way if I don't even live in an abusive household?

Fortunately, I am turning 18 in about 5 months. It will probably take me awhile to get any professional help until I graduate most likely, which is next year. But I am just so terrified that when/if I do get professional help, they will just tell me nothing is wrong and send me on my way.

Okay so, this is a bit long but please listen and help.

I was texting my friend's group chat, consisting of 4 people(including me). And i was goofing off about a hear me out i had. They've also joked about that kind of thing like hear me outs and celebrity crushes, etc. But when i did it one of my friends texted ""I want to leave the gc"" with a broken heart emoji at the end.

And I thought i did something wrong so i said ""no please stay"" with a broken heart emoji, and they said ""if you werent around i prolly wouldve"" with a broken heart emoji. That part really hurt me. Especially since they know i struggled (and still struggle) with Sewerslidal thoughts(mainly passive).

In reply i sent ""sorry, i was trying to joke around. I'll stop"" and they said ""thanks"" in reply. It wasnt a joking around kind of thanks, it was an actual thank you.

I just left the gc after that because i need to protect my mental health. but the text they sent really impacted me. ""if you werent around i would have"" just struck a wrong chord with me. I felt like i was just making their lives worse and that i shouldn't exist.

1jjd986,2025-03-25T07:42:23,"I hate the blackpill so much and I wish that I never discovered it
Edit: I have OCD. I probably should have mentioned that a long time ago. I think that this post (as well as a lot of my replies) will make a lot more sense in light of this fact.

That's pretty much it. The blackpill has ruined my mental health. I want nothing more than to not believe in the blackpill, but I can't convince myself that it isn't grounded in scientific reality. The dual mate hypothesis and hypergamy in particular seem so obviously and undeniably true that I can't help but accept them as fact. We are human beings, and by virtue of being human beings, we are evolved animals. We are not ""souls"" that possess some kind of metaphysical ""free will."" Everything that we will ever say, do or believe is ultimately determined by cold, calculated evolution. Pain and pleasure are the biological mechanisms by which we are compelled to engage in evolutionarily advantageous behaviors as well as avoid evolutionarily disadvantageous behaviors, and we evolved the ability to reason as a means to the end of better informing our behavior, which is itself nothing but a means to the ends of survival and reproduction.

I'm well aware of the reputation of the blackpill as well as the reputation of those who believe in it (typically incels, and I am technically not an incel), but I don't want to hate anybody or blame anybody for the way that things are. I don't blame women and I don't blame feminism; if anything, I blame evolution - I blame the cold, uncaring matter that makes up the entirety of the physical universe. To blame any one person, gender or movement would be to completely miss the point of the deep biological determinism that forms the core of the blackpill worldview.

On a subconscious level, sexual selection is nothing but an algorithm for acquiring the best genes that correlate with objectively, universally advantageous traits.  It would not make evolutionary sense for sexual selection to be anything else. Attractiveness is not subjective - it can be measured and quantified, just like everything else in the physical world.

I could go on, but I won't. I don't know how you could ever possibly deny the blackpill without appealing to some kind of religion or spirituality, and as much as I would like to wholeheartedly believe in some kind of religion or spirituality, I don't. I was never raised in any religion, and I have always had a very materialistic, scientific worldview.

I don't want to believe in the blackpill. I don't think that \*anybody\* really \*wants\* to believe in the blackpill. The blackpill might be the single most depressing, bleak, pessimistic view of reality out there. Nobody takes comfort nor pleasure in the blackpill. Therefore, the only reason that \*anybody\* believes in the blackpill is because it's undeniably true, as unfortunate as that may be.

With all of that being said, please help me stop believing in the blackpill. As I've already said several times, I don't want to believe in the blackpill, and I'm hoping that maybe, just maybe, there's a rational argument against it that will save my mental health and liberate me from this complete pessimism and nihilism.",hate blackpill much wish never discovered edit ocd probably mentioned long time ago think post well lot replies make lot sense light fact thats pretty much blackpill ruined mental health want nothing believe blackpill cant convince isnt grounded scientific reality dual mate hypothesis hypergamy particular seem obviously undeniably true cant help accept fact human beings virtue human beings evolved animals souls possess kind metaphysical free everything ever say believe ultimately determined cold calculated evolution pain pleasure biological mechanisms compelled engage evolutionarily advantageous behaviors well avoid evolutionarily disadvantageous behaviors evolved ability reason means end better informing behavior nothing means ends survival reproduction im well aware reputation blackpill well reputation believe typically incels technically incel dont want hate anybody blame anybody way things dont blame women dont blame feminism anything blame evolution blame cold uncaring matter makes entirety physical universe blame one person gender movement would completely miss point deep biological determinism forms core blackpill worldview subconscious level sexual selection nothing algorithm acquiring best genes correlate objectively universally advantageous traits would make evolutionary sense sexual selection anything else attractiveness subjective measured quantified like everything else physical world could go wont dont know could ever possibly deny blackpill without appealing kind religion spirituality much would like wholeheartedly believe kind religion spirituality dont never raised religion always materialistic scientific worldview dont want believe blackpill dont think anybody really wants believe blackpill blackpill might single depressing bleak pessimistic view reality nobody takes comfort pleasure blackpill therefore reason anybody believes blackpill undeniably true unfortunate may said please help stop believing blackpill ive already said several times dont want believe blackpill im hoping maybe maybe theres rational argument save mental health liberate complete pessimism nihilism,15,20,1,Neutral,Low
1jjcxxc,2025-03-25T07:18:48,"Feeling Overwhelmed and Lost at 25—How Do I Cope with Career and Life Stress?
I’m a 25-year-old guy from a metro city in North India, and I feel completely lost. I work in tech support at a big software company—been there a few years, even got promoted—but I have zero interest in IT or any field. I graduated with a BTech in Computer Science, did a 6-month internship at a major tech company, and landed this job, but I don’t know what I’m doing with my life. The recession and AI replacing jobs keep me up at night, and my workplace is getting more toxic. I’m happy with the work-life balance and pay, but I feel stuck and unmotivated.

I’ve always struggled with focus. Before exams in college, I’d get so anxious I’d do weird stuff like mix 1 rupees Nescafe coffe packets into water bottles and chug them during all-nighters. Now, I’ve picked up unhealthy habits—junk food, weed, porn—that make me feel worse and waste my time. I tried upskilling in things like Snowflake and AWS to boost my career, but I get tired from work and give up on studying. I’ve thought about doing an MBA (my job would sponsor part of it), but I haven’t studied seriously since my college days during COVID, and I’m not sure I can handle it. Weekends are my only escape, and I don’t want to lose them.

One day while doomscrolling Instagram, I stumbled across ADHD memes. I liked them, and social media kept showing me more, which oddly made me feel relaxed—like I’m not the only one who feels this scattered. I even apologized to a friend I once yelled at for not “improving” his behavior (he’s clinically diagnosed with ADHD) after realizing how hard it can be for some people to change. Now I’m reading books like CBT for ADHD to build healthier habits. I know I should see a counselor to get diagnosed, but I had awful experiences last time—one guy was a fearmongering scam artist—and I’m not ready to try again. For now, I’m just reading, not taking meds or anything. I also recently noticed I was forgetting to breathe properly, which was spiking my stress and wrecking my sleep. I’ve been working on it and even managed to meditate twice, which felt like a win.
I live with my parents and my younger brother (he’s in college, studying engineering like me). My dad runs a small hardware business, but he doesn’t want me to join since it’s not doing well. I love spending time with my family, my girlfriend (who I plan to marry, though she’s also job-hunting and stressed), and old school friends—it’s what keeps me sane. But I’m bad at making new friends and feel less ambitious than my college peers, like I’m fading into nothingness. My girlfriend and I want to start an Instagram or YouTube account as content creators—I’m into writing stories, cooking, photography, and making things pretty—but I don’t have the energy to start.

I’ve tried counselors before, but they were bad experiences and too expensive, so I’m hesitant to try again. Lately, I get overwhelmed by career choices and my lack of passion. I just want a job with good pay, work-life balance, and to stay near my family in North India, but I’m scared I’ll lose what I have to AI or burnout. My brother’s working hard to get a job, and I feel pressure to keep up, but I’m exhausted. I treat my family to little food outings sometimes, and it makes them happy, which lifts me up a bit.

How do I deal with this overwhelm? I want to feel motivated again, but I get tired so fast and don’t know where to start.

I have a history of being depressed and I go through cycles of depression and lifted mood (cyclothymia). The thing is I don’t feel sad, although I’ve noticed I’ve been suffering from mood swings recently. 

I’m thinking it’s burnout because of my extremely intense school schedule (last year before Uni). We haven’t had a day off since January and I spend minimum 6-8 hours of school every day and I have to study for exams on top of that. It’s all very overwhelming and I can’t seem to get anything done.

I didn’t immediately identify it as anxiety because it’s a completely different feeling than what I’m used to. Google calls it “sense of impending doom”. And it’s very weird because I can actually sit with the feeling. It makes me reflective.

My spouse has a history of trauma and abuse from childhood. Lately she has started to slap her face and forehead at random times of the day. I continue to tell her to stop and to do anything else but harm herself, but she never does. She spoke with her therapist about it and they say its mainly her attempt to distract herself from the thoughts she has about past trauma. I really dont feel like this is a solution, because she will slap herself sometimes in the dead of night so loud that it wakes me up. She is on all kinds of medications and everything but nothing helps.

Im struggling with this because her condition has been getting worse ever since she started therapy. In my head it feels like they gaslight her into thinking whats going on is ok and its valid to feel the way she does (and it is, just not like this) but thats not helping her get better. She cries more often, the slapping started and now she gets short tempered. Im not sure how to help her because of my own mental health stuff making me disconnected from my emotions from ptsd.

CW: drug mention, self-harm mention

I (M30) live with my friend (M27) and his ex-partner (NB27). When they started dating, it was just him and I, but then the partner moved in shortly after the beginning of the relationship. It became clear that it was soon fraught with fighting, arguing of an indeterminate nature, but I didn't do or say anything in favor of just letting them conclude the relationship whenever it got to be too much. I was, at this point, unaware of the specific mental health status of the partner (who we will call A).

As it happens, after a particularly nasty episode, A came storming down the stairs and yelled at me as an evident continuation of the prior argument, and said ""and you're a f*cking psychopath, don't even TRY to play dumb"".

What followed was a tirade that I can only describe as a psychotic break, accusing me and him of abusing A, manipulating them, teaming up, lying, god knows what else, saying how dare you do this to a mentally ill, suicidal person. The roommate (call him K) came downstairs to try calming things down, and A tearfully asked if he was going to kill them.

It was at that point I said, out loud, ""K, we need to call emergency services or something"", and A blew up and begged and pleaded and chastised me for saying that and K additionally discouraged me doing that as well (albeit calmer). So I didn't.

I asked K later for context, and he told me A has BPD and has outbursts like this frequently, and has a paranoid belief that K and me have been secretly hooking up during their whole relationship. We haven't, ever.

As things stand, A and K are both unemployed, K owns the house and gets unemployment but A doesn't have any support structures apart from a friend or two, and if A is kicked out, they will be homeless. They have both discussed medication and therapy, but for the aforementioned financial reasons, this has yet to take place. A is also a ketamine user and smokes tons of weed every day.

I live in the state of Washington. Are there any affordable ways that A can be cared for or supported that don't involve just continually living here and undergoing cycles of psychosis and paranoia? This is not a sustainable situation. I have preexisting plans to move in with my girlfriend soon, but until then, this is where I live.

1jj9fao,2025-03-25T03:43:50,"Help me idk what to do anymore and I'm scared
I've been feeling bad for a few weeks now. I've had depression and anxiety since I was 12. I'm autistic and I've been an undiagnosed anorexic for almost 4 years now. It's usually manageable I'm 21 I know how to deal with things and I'm on meds that help calm the worst parts down. It hasn't been that bad not like it was before I got on meds but I still don't feel like myself and usually I can wait it out but this time I can't. 

I don't leave my room except for school and work on the weekends. I don't have the mental energy to do anything not even watch a YouTube video about something that normally I'd be into. I still watch things but it's old stuff that I'd watch back in hs before things got more difficult. I still like them they bring me comfort but I think it's weird I can't focus on the new stuff that I know normal me would be interested in that I like my usual documentary and drama channels but I just don't have the brain space for it I guess. 

I feel numb alot. I can't focus on my schoolwork which since I'm in the last 6 weeks of the semester is something I'm really freaking out over. Luckily my English class is in person and it's more of an if you show up you pass thing also English is an easy grade for me despite the trouble I have with my professor nothing bad he just in his words dosent do computers so most of our work in class is worksheets and we only submit our essays online because it's required I think and he takes forever to get them back. 

Last one I turned my paper in the day after it was released about 2 weeks early because he changed the deadline the next day because he messed something up. He waited till the day the paper was due to tell me I had messed something up and had to redo it. You can imagine how stressed I was. Thank god my girlfriend helped me with the rewrite cuz idk how I could have done it myself in one day. It's been 2 weeks btw and I still haven't gotten it back. I finally asked him about it today he said he forgot about it but he should have it graded in a week or two. Today's class we were supposed to be researching for our last essay of the semester before our final exam but he forgot to double check with the librarian so we did not do that today. Was kinda disappointed cuz that's one of my favorite things about writing and I picked an interesting topic for my essay. Instead we just spent the class period doing a practice quiz for our exam which I'm pretty sure I failed. 

I just can't do anything right my focus is bad things go in one ear out the other. Even when I should know the answer it's literally right in front of me I just can't get it and it's so frustrating I want to cry. I missed a few of the online zoom meetings for my french online class. They're not mandatory but we have to show up at least 7 times before the semester. I haven't been to one all month and I still have 3 more left to do. 

My history class is also online. It's the most simple class I have but also the most difficult. It's always just reading the textbook and regurgitating it back on a paper. It's very time consuming and I've had to learn with this class how to manage time and do an hour or two of work on the paper for a few days because you can't write an entire chapter overview in one afternoon like you can with most other assignments. So for my history last weeks assignment didn't get done. I had the questions written out I tried to read the textbook answer was literally right in front of me but it just didn't stick in one ear out the other. I know I can do it compared to a whole chapter overview a few questions even if they're essay style should be easy but I just couldn't. I feel bad it was due yesterday at midnight but I just couldn't do it. Idk what's wrong with me my grades can't afford to slip not now not when I'm so close to finishing the semester. 

I usually can just wait episodes like this out but I can't do that now I have responsibilities and stuff. I've had thoughts of suicide alot lately. I haven't attempted anything but last week I kinda ended up locking myself in my room scared to death cuz I was so close to doing something. It was a really tough night texted a hotline twice but idk if they really helped. Last night at work I felt so close again it took over if I wasn't at work I would have slashed my arm up bad. I ate a burger there at work got freaked out cuz of the calories and it just spiraled from there. My girlfriend managed to talk me down later when I was almost done with work so when I got home I didn't do anything but I know I was close literally if I wasn't at work I'd be having to wear long sleeves for weeks till the cuts healed.

Idk what to do anymore. I don't want to do anything but I have to be myself again. I don't want to let normal me down. I don't want my girlfriend to worry about me so much she's the best thing in my life and I want to be better for her. I tried taking weed the day after my first suicidal episode. I don't do it often my parents are really strict and I'm scared of my mom but I'm at home alone alot when I don't have school or work so I was free to do it. I didn't take too much just enough to calm me down and it did help. I was calm and happy almost for the rest of the day and part of the next day too but it didn't really last so now I know that whatever is going on isn't something as simple as I need to relax. 

I just want someone to listen and tell me what to do because I don't know and I don't think I want to experiment with drugs the last one my psychiatrist put me one turned me into someone else. I wasn't me like I was but there was something else taking over my body I wasn't acting or thinking right. I stopped taking them after 2 or 3 weeks. It was the most unsettling experience I've ever had with a drug and I don't ever want to go through that again. I'd rather be me but anxious and depressed than a pod person.

I’m afraid my girlfriend is going to leave me.
     And no, she hasn’t really done anything to make me believe it. If anything, I did. But, not while we were together. We’ve broken up before and I didn’t think we would get back together. I did something with someone. You can fill in the gaps. I told her what had happened, because she wanted to be with me. She broke up with me first, her mental health was bad, she was scared, and it was too much—that maybe I’m too much? I am too much, im aware. I know. I did what I did, when we broke up because before she said to me that she was happy without me. Mind you, this was only a couple days after we hadn’t spoken. We had spoken everyday for nearly 2 years, throughout the day. “For the first time in what feels like forever” happiness bullshit. So I told her something like “ok goodbye then”. Oh, I cried. I sobbed. It was the worst feeling ever. It was like grieving someone who was still alive. Grieving someone who you could see, could text, could call, and argue with. I remember exactly how I felt, exactly where I was. I was driving, looking at my phone. The way your heart drops to the bottom of your stomach, it almost feels like your lungs deflate for a second, it’s hard to breathe. Your chest hurts. But anyways, the person asked to hangout and I said yes. Sometime in the night, she started blowing my phone up.She regretted it . I think the worst thing is, I did what I did, after I knew how she felt. We got back together after 2 months, I told her no. She would regret being with me, it would mess with her. She insisted. I was right. It messes with her. Badly. I didn’t do it to be malicious. But truly, I thought we wouldn’t get back together even when I knew how she felt. Why? Because, we had issues before that, our own personal issues we needed to work on. In those 2 months, she did what she needed to do… to at least make some progress. (Trust me, it doesn’t happen overnight. I know) Before, she wouldn’t have even done THAT. We talk about our life all the time. The future, the kids, the dogs,the house with a lake, and pools. I love talking about it with her, I love seeing her, and imagining it with her. I want it so badly but what if she can never get over it. She says she wants it to. I know it’s not just what I did that bothers her, it’s how I am. I’m a lot and idk. I just, I’m scared. This seems childish and unnecessary. Probably, idiotic, to think I won’t lose her again, to think I could keep her after what I did. Her feelings are so valid, I tell her that. I care. She’s so patient with me. She listens to me.

TW: discussion of death 

I'm not sure where else I can seek advice so I'm back to reddit again. Things have been calm (or should I say numb) for some time but recently my psychosis has come back again as it always does. I've been suffering with insomnia and delusions, have been basically not functional because of it(not eating, not working, unable to communicate with anyone). This is a common occurrence and I got used to it, most of time I just suffer through it until the fear and delusions calm down a little. I'm unfortunately also suicidal and prone to attempting it.

This time something horrible has happened to our family. An elderly relative has passed away and her daughter's only family left is basically me and my parents. This has snapped me out of my stagnation a little, but I'm definitely not stable enough to properly help her. I've been doing my best to support her in every way I could (mostly financially), gave her my last savings, sold some belongings to help with all the expenses. With that being said I'm really not sure if I personally can handle witnessing death firsthand in my current state. 

I am by no means trying to make this about myself. Her pain is definitely bigger than mine  and even if it requires for my psychosis to get worse, I'll still be there for her. I just don't know how I can make this more bearable. My recent source of panic was death and I was having obsessive thoughts and even hallucinations related to it, which was also causing me to lose the ability to properly sleep. And I'm terrified of thinking about going through the whole process of seeing it now while I'm in this state. 

You know how death is, even when you know someone is nearing it, even when you're not even close to that person, it still feels unexpected and so heartbreaking. The idea of going through this not too long after your own attempt is also a... strange feeling. 

Is there anything I can do to not have an absolute breakdown and be helpful for my cousin? While I'm more present now, I still have the nightmarish visions and panic attacks, so I have no idea how I can prepare myself for the actual funeral and burial. Anyone has any idea how I can 'force' this episode to go away?

1jitjpc,2025-03-24T16:35:01,"Mostly a Neurodivergent Rant
Hello All,

As a preface, suggestions and help are appreciated, but I have been doing obsessive research on all of my mental health, so keep that in mind.  I (M39) will try to be as open as possible about myself inside and out as I go, but this account is also anonymous so I have to clip details when they get a little too personal.

TL;DR:  I thought I was making progress, only to have new setbacks and it has not quite exactly filled me with hope.  I haven't given up nor do I intend to on finding solutions and answers for myself, but damn, I feel like I got reset to square 1.

Okay, formalities out of the way, hey all.

So recently I was advised to do a neuropsych exam because I have been diagnosed with ADHD for about 10 years now and told my current therapist that I feel something else is at play.  Turns out, there was. While knowing this changes nothing if left untreated, and I can continue on as normal, I obviously want to correct my shortcomings.  Here is a short list, starting with diagnoses and then moving on into terms that may be mental health related but also may not be a thing in themselves.

-ADHD  

-Depression  

-Generalized Anxiety  

-PTSD (SA Victim+Bullying+Life)  

-Dissociative Amnesia (Its not terrible, but concerning for sure.)  

-Dissociation/Depersonalization  

-RSD (Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria)  

-PDA (Pathological Demand Avoidance)  

-Autism Traits (PTSD is blocking the ability to diagnose/rule out autism.)  

-Alexithymia  

-Merinthophobia  

-(Claustrophobia?)  The above might be the true problem here, just recently found out there was a word for fear of being bound (tl;dr its the phyical state of being bound that panics me, not the idea of it.)  

-Acrophobia  

-Possible Borderline  

-Possible but unlikely Bipolar  

-Emotional Numbness  

-Executive Dysfunction, like this is the worst symptom I think I have.  0 Ability to prioritize.  

-Porn Addiction? (Look, it probably is, but if so, its just over the line so IDK?  I don't want to admit it to myself for some reason.  Will check porn in inappropriate places, but privately of course.)  

-Video Game Addiction? (This was bad, but has now stabilized, I guess.  Not sure if it was ever an addiction since I used to game like 60hr/wk and now its like 10 if I am lucky, but I also had nothing much else to do so back then, so is it an addiction if you choose to fill your free time with it?)  

-Very strong need for perfectionism at times  

-Very strong need to know the answer to a question if it suits me. (Will obsessively chase an answer for days even if its not worth it.)  

-Very strong rejection reaction when I get blindsided by perceived harsh or  incorrect criticism.  

I think that's it, just mainly typing the list out for myself so I have a reference point.  

Note#1: While I am going to talk about my relationship at times and it may not sound rosy, the relationship itself is not a thing that is a debate for me.  If you have helpful comments that build communication, I welcome them, but debate on if I should leave/stay is not welcomed.  Please just trust me that if you're thinking something, I have already analyzed many different aspects to our relationship and I choose to move forward knowing what I know.  Its very hard to sneak intentions past me.  

Note#2: I am open to DMs if you'd like to privately discuss anything mental health related at any time, if something in my post resonates with you.  Discussions only though, don't just DM me to ask a bunch of questions about myself or my symptoms.  I would rather  questions about my mental health issues be asked here so that maybe someone could benefit from the post one day.  

Note#3: This is intended to essentially be a journal of sorts as the act of writing all of this out is my therapy.  As such, I probably will update and edit it until I feel it has served its purpose.  

Now, lets get to why I am here, venting.  

So, I guess I could stop here and just go AHHHH LOOK ABOVE DO I NEED TO GO ON?  But, I won't do that today.  So, yeah lets get to current day then I guess walk it back as I go.  So, about a couple months ago, I got diagnosed with Dissociative Amnesia and PTSD with autism traits.  I had suspected something was fucking with my memory that wasn't just ADHD.  I started to wake up and realize that memory gaps in my life are not normal, and after some googling, I found some things that could cause what I have.  Walked in theorizing one of the aforementioned could be the culprit, WHOOPS, might be all 3.    

So here I am sitting with this new information, and no clue now where to go from here.  I felt that my management of ADHD was already a task, and now I gotta try to walk back habits and trauma minted 20-30 years ago.  This new information helped me and hurt me.  Now, I have some new information and with that comes the tools to treat said disorders, YAY!  Oh but wait, now I realize I know very little about treating these things and unlike ADHD, there isn't usually a little magic pill to help you along halfway.  Not to say you can't manage without medication, but I think it's safe to say it helps.  It was a sobering reality and I kinda just went into a depression shortly after the diagnosis.  After recovering from that, I really needed a new plan, which I am working with my therapist on.  

I think the most frustrating out thing out of all of these issues is it means that I am confused like half the time (trying not to be hyperbolic, might be less, but is significant.) as to where I am, what I am doing, what I was saying, really anything.  My ADHD or Amnesia frequently erases my immediate term memory and then my ADHD or Amnesia also erases weeks at a time of details when I get overwhelmed.  Its not total forgetfulness, and with the right reference, I can recall things.  But my mind will just go oh hey, logic took over for a while, you can be a human again out of nowhere, then I quickly realize that I have been depressed/stressed for a month.  I have vague memories of this timeframe, almost none of the details, but I get a good enough feeling that I existed and carried on as normal as I could during that period, so its not a concerning loss of memory, just...really annoying?  Often times my memory will cause interpersonal issues, as I will tell the same story 16 times to everyone I know, but possibly not even remember even one instance, for example.  That means me being told things is always subject to not making it to the hard drive in my head, and it happens more frequently when I don't want to do something.  


Moving on to another thing, the RSD and PDA.  These are also a couple of the worst, because the RSD makes me feel legitimately crazy sometimes and the PDA just defiantly flies in my face inhibiting my own plans and goals.  I have to fucking agree with my brain on tasks, otherwise it's the hardest thing in the world now to me.  It looks like I'm just being childish, but I can't understate how much mental effort it takes to overcome this feeling somtimes.  Imagine telling your brain no, then it just says ""fine, try doing your task without me,"" then proceeds to become a paperweight and I either get no thoughts or a mixture of my brain telling me what to do vs me trying to do affirmations to override the block, with limited success.  Then, I get RSD with myself because I don't want to let #1 down, so I get emotional and upset because I can't do something I should be able to.  If only I could show everyone what this dynamic is like in real life, because, almost all of the time, I get ""you're lazy, you're just trying to get out of work,"" or ""its not that big of a deal just do it.""  Internal me knows all of this, knows that it is my own mind holding me back, and it doesn't change anything.  I would love to have my chores done all the time, I even feel great from the satisfaction, but my brain seems to think work is for suckers.  

The last point I'll make for now is:  

Well hey at least I get benefits of my brain being ridiculously good at specific things due to some of these issues.  WISH I COULD JUST BE NORMAL AND DO WORK NOW   

PS:  RSD also is paralyzing me in social situations and makes me feel crazy for getting upset because I took something the wrong way.  

P.P.S: I want to also touch on the emotional numbness later.  

P.P.P.S:  I may get into it, but my S/O cannot help me with my journey at this time, so that's why I chose reddit to vent to.

1jiwuc3,2025-03-24T18:46:41,"I really think I was mistreated by the police, and I’m pretty sure they didn’t file paperwork?
So, it’s kind of a long story but I will try to be succinct. I have mental health issues (C-PTSD), and they were being exacerbated by the abusive environment I was in, greatly. At one point I reached out to a mental health crisis team in the area and I was given the option of a short term stay at a mental health respite place. I figured it was worth a shot, so I went. When I got there, there was only one employee and she was acting, in my opinion at least, very unprofessional, immature, and disinterested-and became pretty rude when I said as much. 

(The behaviors I noticed were her pretty much being annoyed when I even showed up because she had to get off her phone, and her absolute disinterest in the process of checking me in.)

I continue talking a bit of shit as I get amped up emotionally, she continues handling it really poorly for a supposed mental health professional. At a certain point she deemed me to be too belligerent and called the police-again, at no point was she professional or trying to work with me, she was just very dismissive and disinterested. As someone who’s been in mental health centers a handful of times, this just didn’t seem appropriate to me.

Anyway-the police arrive, and keep in mind, this was Texas…so, naturally they were douchebags. They didn’t listen to my side at all, kept telling me to stop talking. The woman’s boss showed up and was also talking down to me, trivializing/mocking the state of my mental health, and said that she worked at my then therapy clinic and basically threatened to tattle on me there. 
Then, the police tell me I have two options; stay there and shut up, or walk home alone. It was around midnight or 1 am, and I am a petite woman. That didn’t seem safe to me, I was about to suck it up and sleep until morning, and then the first woman’s superior revoked that option and said they “didn’t want me there.”

The police said, “You heard her. Grab your stuff and start walking home.”
I felt trapped and panicked and thought, I’m not going to risk getting assaulted (or worse) on the way home, I have to do something. Then I proceeded to punch the original staff member I had encountered in the face, so that I could spend the night in jail and not wandering around the streets of a city I had just moved to with a dead phone. I KNOW, it wasn’t the smartest move in retrospect-particularly not in front of two police. Obviously, I got arrested.

They were quite rough, despite me hitting her once and then laying myself down on the floor with my hands behind my back. I felt a knee digging into me, the handcuffs click firmly around my wrist-and then, 3 more clicks as I feel them squeeze my circulation off. They openly mocked me with their words.

When I arrived at the jail, I was still pretty upset, and panicking-it didn’t help that they put me in a creepy windowless concrete cell with an intercom to communicate with and a grate in the floor to piss in, complete with an actual dead rodent inside. Also, no bed. I used the intercom to notify them that I needed my epilepsy meds, which I had on my person when I was arrested. I was told that I was on detox (???) so I couldn’t have my medication. I told them I wasn’t arrested on drug or alcohol charges, but even if I were I’m pretty sure detox doesn’t include prescription medications. They ignored me, and when I didn’t drop it, they turned off my intercom-my only way of communicating with them if I *did* have a seizure.

In the morning, literally the second I could, I bailed out and I haven’t heard anything since, no court summons or anything like that. Apparently it’s still not on my record, either.

1jipihf,2025-03-24T13:31:05,"I don't know what to do
I generally don't know what to do with my life.
I can't feel emotions or empathy, I'm just empty all the time. I don't want to do anything at all either, and the only reason for that is that I don't see the point. I'm just going to die one day so why does what I do in the meantime matter? I know I hate my family, and I don't have any friends, not that it changes anything. I don't have anyone to turn to, I'm truly alone. When I look to the future, I don't see the point in it. Why bother when you'll die and then be forgotten one day? I'm hopeless, and I don't know what to do to change it. No matter what I do I don't feel, I don't love and I don't care. What's the point in life if living itself can be so cruel?

I don't know nor do I understand what I am supposed to do in life. I was always called a genius kid or an old soul. But because of this, I was never told how to try, I was always comfortable with being the way I was. So much so that I never tried to improve, and look where that got me. I don't even know if there's anything I can do to feel better. I go to a therapist and have been for the past year, but all that's got me is online schooling and that isn't even helping. I feel like I just need to be locked away and forgotten, maybe that would be the best outcome.


I'm sorry if this was too much or too heavy of a subject but I really needed to get this off of my mind.

1jipf9u,2025-03-24T13:26:40,"Taking sick leave: Am I anxious or selfish?
Hello - so I have been working for an animal charity which should be the most amazing place to work. I’ve been there for nine months and just handed my notice in as it’s the most toxic place I have ever worked. I’m a very anxious person though and I’m really worried that it has warped my perception of what has happened. I’ve had a lot going on in the background personally too and feel incredibly burnt out and that it is has all got too much for me. I should have another three weeks to work but desperately feel like I need to take some time off for my mental health so that I can go into my new job full and happier. 
I am the fourth person in a few weeks to leave this place but there are lots of people staying, although a lot of these people complain a lot about the place. A few of us sent in anonymous emails to our CEO because we were so unhappy with how toxic the atmosphere was/is and how the majority of this is down to our manager, as well as concern for the welfare for some of the animals. I feel really sh***y that I sent it in anonymously as I now feel really two faced and it caused a lot of drama which is not me. There was an investigation but the CEO basically backed the manager and didn’t listen to our concerns. Since then the manager has been over the top nice and now I am so confused, has my poor mental health made everything up that she did? Did I just get influenced by colleagues that have left?

For the past 8 months my life has gone from the best I'd ever been to the lowest I've ever felt and I feel like I'll never recover. 8 months ago my grandma died of a heart attack and in the following months my grandpa's health started to decline as well due to old age, stress, etc...he ended up being in a vegetative state. it had mentally destroyed me and made going on with my normal life impossible. I've had suicidal thoughts and completely petrifying depression since my grandma passed and my girlfriend had been very supportive for me. She knew I was depressed but not suicidal. I eventually told her during an emotional breakdown where I just randomly started crying out of the blue and all she said was ""okay"". I thought in my hysterical state I was just receiving her comment wrong but it didn't sit right with me and it made me more upset but I tried to hide it the best I could. Then 3 months ago she breaks up with me and says that she doesn't feel loved the way that she deserves to be. But she still cares about me and wants to keep in contact with me because of the way I'm feeling. I'm absolutely defeated by this i don't have the emotional strength to fight this decision I'm just broken. But we stayed in loose contact messaging every few days when she'd check on me for about a month. Then she stopped. I waited almost 2 weeks and asked her if she was busy cause I wanted someone to talk to about how I was feeling and that I missed her. She just flat out tells me to get over it that it been almost 2 months and to move on. I find out from a mutual friend that's she's already with someone else. How can people be like this. I lost people that I care about and you punish me for it. I need someone and she lied to me just pretending to care. I feel absolutely wronged and I feel so empty.

Taking sick leave: Am I anxious or selfish?

Hello - so I have been working for an animal charity which should be the most amazing place to work. I’ve been there for nine months and just handed my notice in as it’s the most toxic place I have ever worked. I’m a very anxious person though and I’m really worried that it has warped my perception of what has happened. I’ve had a lot going on in the background personally too and feel incredibly burnt out and that it is has all got too much for me. I should have another three weeks to work but desperately feel like I need to take some time off for my mental health so that I can go into my new job full and happier. 
I am the fourth person in a few weeks to leave this place but there are lots of people staying, although a lot of these people complain a lot about the place. A few of us sent in anonymous emails to our CEO because we were so unhappy with how toxic the atmosphere was/is and how the majority of this is down to our manager, as well as concern for the welfare for some of the animals. I feel really sh***y that I sent it in anonymously as I now feel really two faced and it caused a lot of drama which is not me. There was an investigation but the CEO basically backed the manager and didn’t listen to our concerns. Since then the manager has been over the top nice and now I am so confused, has my poor mental health made everything up that she did? Did I just get influenced by colleagues that have left? Is it ok to take time off for myself? I am so worried what people left at work will think of me. My mind is spiralling everyday and I don’t know what’s right or real anymore ☹️ has anyone else ever been in a similar situation?

1jiloha,2025-03-24T09:08:21,"It feels like we are falling apart..
I am 17 years old — a boy trapped in a cycle of self-destruction.
I procrastinate, I watch porn, I vape, I carve my pain into my skin.
For five years, I have been nothing but a ghost.
Now, I have no friends.
Not one.
My family, lost in their own vices, drowns out my presence.
Often, I just want to disappear forever.

She is 18.
A girl with a heart too big for this world.
She calls herself a people pleaser.
Unfortunately she gives until there’s nothing left of her.
Life never made things easy.
People used her, betrayed her, left scars too deep to fade.
She’s lost good friends, suffered panic attacks that steal the air from her lungs.
She believes she doesn’t deserve food, doesn’t deserve care.
She cuts herself.
She has tried to die — more than once.

And yet, somehow, we found each other.

It started three months ago.

That night, I tried to end my life.
But morning came, and I was still here.
So I wrote.
Poured my pain into a Reddit post, hoping someone, anyone, would hear me.
No one did.

Until her.

She sent a message.
Told me she was sorry.
That I deserved more.
Gave me words I never knew I needed.
I thanked her, thinking that was the end of it.

But the next day, she asked if I had eaten.
If I had drunk enough water.
(At the time, I barely ate at all.)
I answered.
Then I answered again.
And again.
And again.

Soon, we spoke every day.
Hours passing like seconds.
We unraveled everything—our pasts, our fears, our dreams, the pieces of ourselves we never dared to show the world.
There was no judgment.
No shame.
Only understanding.

Weeks passed before we understood.

One evening, I bought flowers, took a picture, and told her she meant the world to me.
She was quiet at first.
Then, she told me she loved me.
A moment later, I said it back.
It felt so right.

We grew closer.
Every whispered „I love you,” every „I wish I could hold you”, every „I want to fall asleep beside you and wake up to your warmth” pulled us deeper into something neither of us had ever known.
For both of us it's the first relationship.

And then came desire.

The thought of her ignited something inside me.
A longing.
To touch.
Neither of us has ever known intimacy, but if we were together, we would.
Slowly. Gently. Desperately.
Not just for the act itself, but for the connection, the feeling of being real in each other’s arms.
She wants that.
I want that.
We developed passionate fantasies together.
She tells me she would give herself to me completely.
She says it over and over.

But the world is cruel.
We are over six thousand kilometers apart.
Don't speak the same language.
Our English is bad.
It leaves no room for calls, for video, for more than just words on a screen.
We are trapped in distance, in silence.
And it is unbearable.
I'm also scared of direct contact.
It's so complicated.

She loves me with every piece of herself.
I know that.
But I cannot let her cling to a shadow she will never touch.
And yet, she won’t let go.
„Anything for you.”

I am still that same lost boy, drowning in my own darkness.
I am immature.
I am not a good person.
Not even close.
And yet, I make her happy.
I don’t understand why, but I do.

I can’t even maintain a normal friendship.
How could I ever hold onto love?
All the dreams we share — I know they will never become reality.
And it crushes me.
It makes me want to scream.

I don’t want to lose her.
She is my first love.
My only love.
The deepest connection I have ever known.
But I feel us slipping.

If I walk away, I fear she won’t survive it.
And I cannot bear that weight.

But if we stay, this pain will only grow.
I know that, too.

What am I supposed to do?
What the hell am I supposed to do?

I don’t want to let her go.
Because if I do, I will never find someone like her again.

I (15) have a partner who I love very much. As weird as it sounds, I’ve developed this horrid fear that they might feel forced to stay with me and wouldnt leave if they were unhappy.

Our relationship is going really well, with no issues between us, so this fear doesn’t really make sense. Still, Im oddly terrified that they might eventually feel like they have to stay with me out of fear that I would kill myself if they left.

I dont think that my partner currently feels trapped Im more worried in a future sense, I dont want it to turn into one of those stories you hear about the crazy ex-gf :( Id also never threaten to hurt myself if they tried to leave but still Im so scared of this.

I seem to have developed a situation over many years whereby if my husband is out I find it hard to relax and sleep until he is home.  I can also feel anxious and abandoned.  This seems to have stemmed from some kind of trauma of being abandoned somewhere down the line and has very much manifested in me not being able to sleep when he is out.  And a feeling of great anxiety.  But I’ve also realised that this extends out to other people also now.  For example, when visiting my sister I experienced the same feeling when she went out with her husband and didn’t come back til the early hours of the morning.  I basically was awake and feeling quite anxious.  Once they come back it takes me a while to settle down and relax.

Hi. I've always struggled a little with my mental health, but at the moment it's so bad it's very overwhelming. I feel like a lot of issues and insecurities have piled up on me and I don't know where to start unravelling them. I have a few goals for what I need to work on, so if anybody could share what helps them I'd appreciate it.

For context I will add that I was diagnosed with epilepsy last year, and I was put on keppra, a medicine that made me incredibly depressed. I am coming off it now but it's a very slow process so I have minimum a month more of essentially chemical depression to go, and I've never been so close to ending things so I need ways to get through the next little while at least.

1. I have a strong fear of judgement and abandonment when it comes to friends. Friendships are extremely important to me but after years of being the boring smart friend I always assume the worst even with the best people. I need to learn some confidence in my authentic self and how to be more lenient with people while still not getting walked over (because I am a people pleaser).

2. I need little ways to make my busy tiring college days a bit brighter, and ways to appreciate what I have. When I get home I have to go to bed very early since I commute so much, so i have less time for my hobbies then I'd like. 

Some suggestions of journalling or CBT exercises that helped you with depression or anxiety would also be brilliant.

My mental health is at its lowest due to me not having self control. I (18f) has always been insecure about my weight since I’ve been in 2nd grade. When I was in 2nd grade I gained a lot of weight over the summer due to my over eating. In that time my mom made it very known she didn’t like it. Making fun of me in front of my family, friends , and waitresses. Yelling at me for wanting McDonald’s like the rest of the kids in my family. Even one memory of her coming home drunk from a bar making me sit in the living room as she told me how pretty I would be if were skinny. And how many guys would want me. My way to cope with all of the stuff was eating more which sounds stupid. I was heavy until my 8th grade when I had my first crush on this boy. During that time, I only ate one thing a day that way I would lose weight and be skinny. Cuz in my head the only way anyone would want me if I was skinny. I lost the weight and my mom was so happy with me. I worked out everyday. Only at 500 to 100 cal for a long time. When I got into sophomore year I started eating normal cal and working out a lot. My mom and me were close and anytime someone was starting drama with me, her responds was always “ there just jelous on how u look” it sound stupid but I thrived for that. During my sophistry year I learned I had to go into surgery due smthing wrong with me. When I got outta my surgery they gave me these pills I had to take. One of the side effects was weight gain. So I took to pills and in my luck i ended up gain 20lb. It sucked cuz I wasn’t even allowed to work out anymore. I everything turned around my mom and I started fighting again. She tried to restricted my food like she once did it made me super sad for awhile. Now im in my senior year and idc what she has to say about it anymore.

1jig8dj,2025-03-24T03:11:13,"Struggling After Pediatric Patient Death
Let me start out by saying I have always felt like the ER was the right place for me. I’ve been a nurse for several years now, and over half of my career has been ER. These are my people and I feel this is my calling. I’ve seen plenty of physical/mental trauma and death. No one likes it of course, but I’ve always felt mentally strong enough that I can handle it, be there for my patients on their worst days. I also feel like I have good resources when it gets tough. But now, I am a new mother. It is becoming increasingly difficulty to not attach myself emotionally to certain situations. Specifically pediatrics. 
Just recently I had a very traumatic pediatric cardiac arrest. Baby was at daycare, it doesn’t appear there was anything that would point to abuse or neglect. After a grueling and lengthy resuscitation, we got them back. But we knew what the outcome would be and after a few days in PICU, the baby was allowed to pass. 
I am struggling. I’ve cried almost every evening. I find myself asking why over and over. I can hear the mother crying and begging for baby not to leave. The visual memories replay in my head. I tell myself, this is NOT my grief. A whole entire family is hurting way more than I could possibly imagine. But I ache so much for them. How they had to see us work tirelessly on their baby, how violent resuscitation looks from their perspective, how the last time they saw baby alive, everything was just fine! Just a normal day ripped apart by this terribly traumatic event that has forever changed their lives. I remember seeing the relief on her face when we got ROSC. When deep down I knew what the scans would show. I wanted so damn badly to be wrong, that they would recover. I wanted to pick baby up and hold them so close, every motherly instinct in me was screaming. 
I came home and sobbed on my husband and on my child who is just over a year old. And I’ve done that nightly since the event. A once strong ER nurse now questioning if I can continue to do this. How do you separate yourself? How do you not fear every little thing that could cause harm or worse to your own child? How does a seemingly healthy baby lie down and never wake up?

So as of 6 years ago I started to develop terrible anxiety. It kept me from going out much and doing just alot of stuff in my teen years. The anxiety has progressed really bad now, I am unable to leave my house without getting terrible anxiety attacks. However they aren't normal anxiety attacks. It started to effect me physically about 4 years ago, Once my anxiety goes up I will instantly start to have diarrhea. Now I am unable to leave or do anything since I will always require a bathroom. I am not able to live a normal life with going out with my friends or now I learned even having a friend over causes the anxiety. My anxiety activates with anything that is not normal for me. Anything that is not living a shut in neet life gets my anxiety up and I have no clue why. I don't even know how or why all of this started but I can't figure out any ways to help.   
  
I have tried anxiety medication but non have seemed to help. I tried 2 different kinds but nothing ever fixed it. I know smoking weed or alcohol could fix how I feel temporarily but I refuse to do those things. I haven't met anyone with such severe anxiety like me and I need to find some sort of way to atleast subside things temporarily. I am 21 years old and haven't been able to do much of anything with my life due to this. If anyone thinks of something that could either help me, or if I should contact someone please let me know. Or if this sounds like something similar to something you went through but was able to fix let me know as well",severe anxiety attacks 6 years ago started develop terrible anxiety kept going much alot stuff teen years anxiety progressed really bad unable leave house without getting terrible anxiety attacks however arent normal anxiety attacks started effect physically 4 years ago anxiety goes instantly start diarrhea unable leave anything since always require bathroom able live normal life going friends learned even friend causes anxiety anxiety activates anything normal anything living shut neet life gets anxiety clue dont even know started cant figure ways help tried anxiety medication non seemed help tried 2 different kinds nothing ever fixed know smoking weed alcohol could fix feel temporarily refuse things havent met anyone severe anxiety like need find sort way atleast subside things temporarily 21 years old havent able much anything life due anyone thinks something could either help contact someone please let know sounds like something similar something went able fix let know well,1,0,0,Neutral,High
1jigwva,2025-03-24T03:47:48,"How to get help
I need someone to help me understand this. If this is my mom taking advantage of me and me maybe wanting to commit. Before i start i just want to say, im sorry if this does get removed, im unsure where to put this/what to say, i did deep read the rules but i might have missed something so i am sorry about that, as well as that i am dyslexic and if some of my paragraphing is rushed/can’t be understood, im sorry about that. I will try to sensor any triggering words with $ or symbols in the word, but i might forget too. Thank you for taking ur time to read my struggle.


My mom has always been there for me, but we moved away from her ex bf who used to be super abu$ive and controlling. He used to keep me away from food and lock me away in my room, alarms and taking everything from me, my mom followed in his footsteps, agreeing with him, screwing the door to all my bedding and clothes away in a different room. When i tried to eat, i was punished. This was mostly during summers about 2016, maybe 2018, I don’t remember. I’m still young now and almost out of high school so it’s been a while. But my mom finally saw how bad she was and how bad her ex bf was so she left after he hit her for the last and final time with me and we were homeless for a little. We went back and grabbed our stuff and left, now I live right next to my boyfriends moms house and in an apartment, and my mom has a new boyfriend and I’m close to my school.

But ever since we moved here into this apartment, I have felt depressed, I’ve felt su!c!d@l, I almost checked myself into a mental hospital bc I felt so depressed. My mom is never home, she works at a train company so her jobs in the morning but she’s never home at night. She’s at her boyfriends or out drinking. I’ve been basically living on my own, I pay my own phone bill, I buy groceries every money most of the time and I clean the house. I’ve basically been a maid for my mom and I don’t feel like a daughter to her anymore and more like a Roommate. She’s been getting more aggressive and has been treating me like shit and her excuse it “I don’t have rights bc I’m still young and I can’t vote”, so I sit quietly. I make our food, I take the trash out, I make sure all the almost expired food in the fridge is eaten and she calls me a “brat, entitled” she says to me all the time “I wish I would have raised you sheltered so you weren’t so liberal.” I work about 20 hours a week to keep up with our apartment, I go to school and i try to study and learn and focus but yk 4 hours almost every night at my job and then 6 hours of sleep just to wake up at 5:30 am after going to bed at like 11;30 pm bc of work doesn’t help my grades. 

About me being su!c!d@l, I do SH and I take THC to help with the pain and I like I have a good relationship with my boyfriend but I SH when I’m overwhelmed/panicked it’s a bad bad habit. But it’s been getting better. Last night as I’m writing this, I didn’t eat anything really and I passed out after trying and thr0w!ng up my food and my boyfriend found me and tried to help me and I cried and cried about my stomach hurting, my mom, school, work. Today my thighs and arms and stomach still hurt, I cut my hair off a lot and my mom yelled at me but it’s better then yk hurting myself to much. But now I feel bad, like I wanna cry and sit in the warmth of my boyfriend, I almost just want to take a much of meds and wake up in a hospital, away from stress of school and work and home. Sometimes I don’t want to wake up, I want to just fall into a deep less sleep of nothing and maybe go onto another life. Crying as I write this but it’s true, my boyfriend is so good to me but I feel like I’m not enough for him and there’s so many other reasons why I’m fucked up and I want to die but also so many why I want to live. 

I just want to ask, should I do something about my mom? My dad doesn’t live in the US anymore and so I can’t go to him for living. 

I also want to ask, is there any good ways of getting help without a mental hospital or anyways I could help myself other then buying stuff/impulse buying or SH or anything from being su!c!d@l? 

One last thing, should I tell my boyfriend? He helps a lot and last time I got to stay at his dads for a day but that was a one time thing so idk.

1jigyxn,2025-03-24T03:50:51,"Why Do I Think About Suicide
I don’t even really know where to start. So this may seem all over the place. I am divorced, 38 years old with four kids. I remarried and my now wife has a daughter, whose dad is not in the picture and I am in the process of adopting her. I have tried medication. I have tried therapy, but nothing seems to work. I struggle to get negative thoughts out of my head and I am always very pessimistic about everything. I have this unwavering feeling of guilt that I screwed up my kids’ lives by getting a divorce and not being there for them 100% of the time. I fought for four years to get 50% custody. In California, they see a dad trying to get custody as someone who does not want to pay child support and they make it very difficult to get any kind of custody if the other parent is adamant about not giving it to you.  I have struggled with depression as far back as I can remember. I was bullied in school for being “different” because I come from an immigrant family who did not have a lot of money and I was not the best looking and no girl was ever interested in me some of which made it a point to tell me I was ugly or gross. I was sexually abused as a child. I truly think the only reason I have not killed myself is because of my kids if I didn’t have them, I would have zero reason to live. I have a great job make almost 200,000 a year, but that does not fill the void and never will. My depression and anxiety will get the best of me and cause problems between my wife and I. I let everything get to me in my mind just goes down a rabbit hole. I struggle to speak with her because there is a lot she is not sympathetic about and financially it’s a little hard because she spends a lot of money and when I try to bring it up, it turns into a fight. On the surface I’m put together but inside I am an absolute mess and I don’t know what to do. I travel for work so I spend a lot of time in hotel rooms by myself and it absolutely sucks. I really want to find ways to just stimulate my mind and be happier. I really do just want to be happier, but I can’t ever get there.  When I am alone in my hotel rooms, I cry myself to sleep almost every night. I know all of this seems so selfish because I make good money. I have a beautiful family and a beautiful house. I’m just lost.

I'm mentally ,physically and overall very unhealthy, I'm suicidal and depressed and are being medicated. All of the mental health professionals I've met insist on trying to make some friends, obviously we're doing the whole love yourself thing, which has helped, I do respect my body and emotions more, but it's not enough,I still don't really ""love"" myself, I keep thinking that is the goal I have to reach, but I have no drive for it, no motivation.

Lately there has been a bit of a drive, and Im feeling guilty about it, I feel like it not the proper ""motivation"" and will just lead to more disaster.

Like being motivated to stay alive to gamble more, something like that. A good intent but a bad motivation.

There's been a girl in class around my age and *I think* she has an interest in me, emphasis on think, because as a chronically lonely, virgin, it could just be my mind obsessing over someone who has just paid a bit of attention to me, like they would on anyone, and I'm just obsessing over it and being delusional. 

And I'm constantly thinking, if this is true, is it even possible? How could she be attracted to my fatass? I'm a total loser, and telling her about my mental illness would just weird her out wouldn't it? And other questions, like do I genuinely like her or is this just blind love?(reference to previous paragraph)

My mind keeps trying to find excuses to not attempt anything with her, I keep finding imperfections on her, I keep looking at myself in the mirror thinking ""no way..."" , I just obsess over everything, I even think we're not compatible at all, I think I'm just so weird and have such weird interests and humor that noone can ever like me, especially her

Or perhaps love truly is unconditional and I can lover her for who she is and vise versa, but I feel like I can't personally love unconditionally, I feel like an asshole, I also have a porn addiction so my standards have been demolished of what a woman has to look like, I feel sick

But perhaps, this could be the key to improving? This could be the motivation that finally gets me out of this mental health hellhole? Having someone to love? Perhaps I should stop thinking about it so much and just try and do it? Just try, doesn't mean fully commiting, just go out a few times and see how things go? But I'm just too scared. Perhaps I should try making friends first before going near a woman, or perhaps this is gonna be like a book's love story, of a loser finally shining bright from finding love, but that's not how life works i assume ",think saying love look love right im mentally physically overall unhealthy im suicidal depressed medicated mental health professionals ive met insist trying make friends obviously whole love thing helped respect body emotions enoughi still dont really love keep thinking goal reach drive motivation lately bit drive im feeling guilty feel like proper motivation lead disaster like motivated stay alive gamble something like good intent bad motivation theres girl class around age think interest emphasis think chronically lonely virgin could mind obsessing someone paid bit attention like would anyone im obsessing delusional im constantly thinking true even possible could attracted fatass im total loser telling mental illness would weird wouldnt questions like genuinely like blind lovereference previous paragraph mind keeps trying find excuses attempt anything keep finding imperfections keep looking mirror thinking way obsess everything even think compatible think im weird weird interests humor noone ever like especially perhaps love truly unconditional lover vise versa feel like cant personally love unconditionally feel like asshole also porn addiction standards demolished woman look like feel sick perhaps could key improving could motivation finally gets mental health hellhole someone love perhaps stop thinking much try try doesnt mean fully commiting go times see things go im scared perhaps try making friends first going near woman perhaps gonna like books love story loser finally shining bright finding love thats life works assume,1,0,0,Neutral,High
1jhoq12,2025-03-23T03:02:24,"Need help in supporting a friend through mental health struggle
Need advice in helping a friend who's been struggling mentally.
A little background on him:   studying in 12th science suffering from low/negative self worth, regrets, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, self doubt, hopelessness, academic stress/pressure etc. (None of these conditions are officially diagnosed)

#An outline of what has caused his suicidal thoughts recently:
He took a decision a while ago and couldn't stick to it and is about to face/facing the consequences which has led to his suicidal thoughts. As for now, I've taken necessary steps to ensure his well being for the next 2-3 months but I don't know how to help him anymore besides professional help.
P.S: I've always tried my best to help him and never invalidated his feelings.

#The full story:
A couple of months ago he decided to skip his college (high school) mock exam as it would give him enough time to prepare for the final exam which actually mattered and he believed that he could ace it. His parents weren't supportive of his decision initially but came around later (he gave them his word that he'd ace the exam). During phase-1 of the final exam, we had to present something in front of our class for a subject. Now he had mentioned his social anxiety before but he never really seemed that socially anxious to me or to anyone else. But his social anxiety acted up which made him take the first step towards ending his life, fortunately he was kinda caught (not during the act) and we made some arrangement with our teacher that gave him an alternative to the presentation thingy.
During phase-2 of the exam (the written exam), he fucked up real bad. He forgot a lot of things he had studied, lost confidence in himself and what not. Now he says he'd either fail or barely pass the exam. He's afraid to tell his parents about the final exam. He's registered for an entrance exam scheduled for the next month and hasn't been able to start studying yet because of a little procrastination but mostly because of demotivation and he feels like absolute shit. He doesn't value himself as a person worthwhile of life anymore (this isn't new and basically he considers himself nothing but just a failur). So he believes that he's gonna fuck up in the entrance exam as well and even if he performs well, it'll be in vain as he's almost certain that he's gonna fail the final exam held last month (entrance exam score is dependent on the final exam score).

#My advice:
I've advised him to open up to his parents about everything because who knows maybe they might consult a psychologist. He's reluctant to seek professional help because he can't afford it on his own and doesn't want to involve his parents as he thinks they'll consider him to be weak for needing professional help.

#His options (acc. To him)
Now according to him he has two options (the latter being the best in his opinion):
1: Open upto his parents sooner or latter (because the discussion is inevitable as he will have to discuss with them ultimately when the results are out) and then take a drop year which involves pressure from literally everywhere: self+parents+family+the fact that he's wasted a year and failed once+expensive. 
2: End everything before the results are out. According to him, this is the best option as it is the ultimate solution to all of his problems.

Now honestly, I don't wanna lose a great friend like him.  Just a little information about him, he values mental health more than anyone else I know, but is still a little biased about professional help (a little orthodox mindset about professional help ig). Even I'm living with the burden of not having called his parents yet and told them everything which I think would make things worse or weird idk. I could call his parents and tell them everything even if it costs me our friendship because honestly it's way better than regretting having done nothing later.
As for taking a drop year, he's afraid of facing everything once again and is certain the he'll fail once again. He has a very pessimistic mindset and negative views about himself. And looking on the positive side, if he does make it even in a top institution, with or without a drop year, he's afraid of the things he'll have to face in future like socializing+communication+building confidence (he's very underconfident right now). 
P.S: he never really shows whatever he's going through. Always plays dumb or immature or happy/neutral. And he's never had a well/healthy relationship with his parents either so the fact that opening up to his parents is difficult is understandable.

Now my question for you guys is what should he do without feeling more crappy than he already is? Or what can I do for him to ease his sufferings?
Imo, the biggest challenge in front of him that could make things a little easier is opening upto his parents.",need help supporting friend mental health struggle need advice helping friend whos struggling mentally little background studying 12th science suffering lownegative self worth regrets anxiety depression suicidal ideation self doubt hopelessness academic stresspressure etc none conditions officially diagnosed outline caused suicidal thoughts recently took decision ago couldnt stick facefacing consequences led suicidal thoughts ive taken necessary steps ensure well next 23 months dont know help anymore besides professional help ps ive always tried best help never invalidated feelings full story couple months ago decided skip college high school mock exam would give enough time prepare final exam actually mattered believed could ace parents werent supportive decision initially came around later gave word hed ace exam phase1 final exam present something front class subject mentioned social anxiety never really seemed socially anxious anyone else social anxiety acted made take first step towards ending life fortunately kinda caught act made arrangement teacher gave alternative presentation thingy phase2 exam written exam fucked real bad forgot lot things studied lost confidence says hed either fail barely pass exam hes afraid tell parents final exam hes registered entrance exam scheduled next month hasnt able start studying yet little procrastination mostly demotivation feels like absolute shit doesnt value person worthwhile life anymore isnt new basically considers nothing failur believes hes gonna fuck entrance exam well even performs well itll vain hes almost certain hes gonna fail final exam held last month entrance exam score dependent final exam score advice ive advised open parents everything knows maybe might consult psychologist hes reluctant seek professional help cant afford doesnt want involve parents thinks theyll consider weak needing professional help options acc according two options latter best opinion 1 open upto parents sooner latter discussion inevitable discuss ultimately results take drop year involves pressure literally everywhere selfparentsfamilythe fact hes wasted year failed onceexpensive 2 end everything results according best option ultimate solution problems honestly dont wanna lose great friend like little information values mental health anyone else know still little biased professional help little orthodox mindset professional help ig even im living burden called parents yet told everything think would make things worse weird idk could call parents tell everything even costs friendship honestly way better regretting done nothing later taking drop year hes afraid facing everything certain hell fail pessimistic mindset negative views looking positive side make even top institution without drop year hes afraid things hell face future like socializingcommunicationbuilding confidence hes underconfident right ps never really shows whatever hes going always plays dumb immature happyneutral hes never wellhealthy relationship parents either fact opening parents difficult understandable question guys without feeling crappy already ease sufferings imo biggest challenge front could make things little easier opening upto parents,1,0,0,Neutral,Low

Hey. I'm a teenager (16-18; not comfortable saying my actual age), M, in a pretty stressful situation. For years now, my mental health has been declining immensely. I was sexually abused for 2 years between the ages of 9 and 11, and while my abuser is behind bars now, the aftermath of what he did to me practically broke me. I've never been the same. I've developed a couple of disorders over the years such as BPD. My BPD has led me to spiral out and act in ways that I've hated myself for, but I also can't blame my behavior entirely on a disorder. I am not a good person. I'm a sociopath despite also having empathetic traits, I'm a compulsive liar, and something of a narcissist even while I hate my own guts. To make matters worse I'm a shut-in. I have 1 friend irl and we aren't very close. My previous few friendships have ended bitterly, and I rarely leave the house due to my fear of being perceived at all. The only friend I really have (that isn't online) is my mom. And she can never truly understand the depths of what I go through. My mental state has been declining rapidly for months, well, really it's been years, but it's really been noticeable within the last, I'd say nine months. I was in a relationship for about a year, with a girl who I'll call A, but a couple months ago we cut things short. We were fwb for about a week, but that's over now too, because I have continously let A down and shown her that I'm not a good person, unintentionally, but it still happened. She doesn't love me anymore and says she doesn't see herself ever loving me again. I know a lot of you will probably go ""just drop her, she's not that important,"" but that isn't the case for me.

1jhlbak,2025-03-23T00:09:07,"Aching palms and paralysis
Does anyone else, when you feel really hopeless (not to be confused with just sadness but specifically hopeless), have the middle of their palms ache? For me it is moreso in the right hand. Recently it has been accompanied by a feeling of paralysis in the hands for me, like sleep paralysis. One time I couldn’t move at all, or at least my mind had convinced me that I couldn’t. I think it’s interesting because this always happens when my life feels immovable, something I did was fruitless (the best way I can explain is it is like the myth of Sisyphus) - and then my body literally becomes paralyzed, like I had been in whatever situation.

1jhs96u,2025-03-23T06:32:05,"Gee thanks! I never thought of just 'thinking of something else' when I'm stressed
I've been living in a foreign country for 16 years now. I've been in the house I'm in now for 5 years. The past few months have been hell. After years of no issues, suddenly my landlord has issues with everything I do ... the same things I've done since I moved in... She is now trying to make me pay for repairs that are her responsibility (tiles on the balcony, wood frames on exterior windows) by saying that it's my fault -not the tropical sun and rain - that they need repairing. She expects me to pay for them. She told me that I am supposed to pay for the repairs when they were halfway done.... As in she said the tiles need replacing, I agreed, she sent a repairman, then once he finished half the work she goes 'oh ya, you're paying for this.' I contacted a lawyer and she says the best course of action is for me to GTFO asap. It is hard to rent a place here as a foreigner and there aren't a lot of places for rent to begin with. This has shot my anxiety up to 11. The lawyer wants me to avoid talking to the landlord (which is my first choice too) but the landlord keeps texting and each time my phone lights up my heart races and I start physically shaking. I just muted her number for now as I'm typing this because she just (it's 1130pm) another message asking to come over tomorrow so we can talk.... So her number's muted but now I'm super anxious wondering if she's sent anything else.  

So I'm trying to find a place as fast as possible, so far I have 1 option but it's horrible and super far from anything which would completely change how I live my day to day life but right now it's literally my only option. Then I'm also starting to pack and clean all my shit. And I'm teaching online every day. 

After I saw the place today I came back home and cried, like sobbing, shaking crying and I couldn't stop. I could not catch my breath. I messaged the 2 people who I know in town (another foreigner and my cleaning lady) to help me and they're both amazing and trying but both of them said 'don't stress, just stop thinking about it' and it's like that phrase made it worse. Like gee thanks, never thought of that before. I literally can't stop thinking about it, nothing is distracting me, I can't read, crochet, watch anything at all, eat, or sleep. I'm insanely overwhelmed, I need to start packing but I have no idea where to start. I'm on my own until Monday when my cleaning lady is coming to help me clean/pack and rental offices are open. So I'm stuck in a loop til Monday. 

My mom suggested going to a pharmacy and buying some kind of sleeping aid or a night time formula of something just so I can fall asleep but that would mean going out in public and at the moment that's not an option.

So ya, I'm an absolute mess, in a foreign country, stuck in limbo until at least monday. It's fucking great.

1jhkele,2025-03-22T23:26:23,"Im obsessed with kurt cobain and i dont know what to do
sorry if this is formatted poorly or dosent make sense, im not in the best state right now and im on a new medication that makes me feel weird and believe odd things and im still getting used to it (to clarify this is not from the medication, as my infatuation with him started much before i started the medication) I 15F have an extensive history of mental health issues and trauma that ranges back to elementary school so this isnt that horrifying to come to terms with. I've been into grunge music for a decent amount of time, almost 2 years, however it was mostly the band hole and occasionally a few other artists. I never really had an interest in nirvana because it was really annoying that whenever i brought up that i liked hole and courtney love, my parents and others alive to experience the grunge scene always started schizophrenicly rambling about how courtney love is a heartless monster that murdered kurt cobain. My only experience with nirvana back then was hearing smells like teen spirit on the radio which i never really liked. However a couple months ago i decided to see what all the hype was about. I started listening to his songs more and more which  lead to me consuming more media surrounding nirvana, interviews with the band, videos of live shows, clips of him, etc. it was all pretty normal fan behavior. Then i saw the pictures. i think this is really when everything culminated and went downhill. Im autistic and ive had debilitating depression and anxiety as long as i can remember, ive just learned to live with it. i have a slight drug problem. it all kinda started when a little while ago, i wont talk abt what i took bc of rules but i ended up throwing up most of it before it could absorb into my blood. I think i only really got like a third of the actual dosages i took. anyway, in my totally fucked up state, i somehow ended up on youtube on my phone (i dont remember much past this and throwing up) and i ended up on a video of the images of kurt cobain's body that were released by the police in 2016. it changed me. this isnt the first time ive seen death, the images dont even show anything past his shoes and his hand and ive seen much more disturbing images and videos. but this sat with me. after i woke up and somehow collected myself the next morning i went back to the video. i cant stop watching it. i cant look away. this lead me down a rabbit hole into his suicide. i obsessively read his suicide note, look at the images, look at evidence, listen to the last song he played where he talks about shooting himself, watched interviews with courtney after his death, watched clips of him, wrote him letters. we are so similar, he talked about how nobody ever understood him and the world saw him as something he wasnt, i feel the exact same way. he talks about how he feels hes too sensitive like i do. we both use drugs to escape, i could go on and on about everything we have in common and everything amazing about him. hes like everything i am and everything i wish i could be at the same time. my entire life ive felt othered by everybody and its the first time ive ever seen anybody who feels the same way i do. i delusionally think that im the only one who understands him or that he can hear or see me somehow. i know this is silly and its not real. **i dont get any type of pleasure or satisfaction from watching this, i dont relish in his suffering and i really hope it dosent come across this way** whenever i go back to his music or the note or the pictures its extremely upsetting for me and i get extremely depressed, but i keep going back. i think i want some sort of comfort or closure or answer from these things that i never get. instead i always leave with the same lingering conclusion: **if somebody so similar to me, yet so beloved, someone that brought so much light to the world and so many people like me, someone that seemed like he had everybody rooting for him, still cant win, still suffer so much he cant bare to keep going, whats the point of me trying at all..? he was so great, so good and so beautiful inside and out. im nothing like him in that way. why should i even try? whats the point of staying alive.** im probably not going to kill myself. i never knew him but it feels like i do, i disgust myself. i grieve someone that never knew me. yet i feel like he can see me and i can see him. beyond death. no he dosent talk to me im not that fucking crazy. dont tell me im just immature and its some small crush on him, i dont even really like him that way, he was just so beautiful in every way like nobody ive ever seen before. im not some stupid kid that just sees someone they relate to for the first time. its so much more than that. i see him like nobody else did. im aware this is unhealthy and its not normal and its not the first time ive had delusions about things, when i was younger i thought the government had cameras in my computer and in my smoke detector. i used to hallucinate fairly frequently but it has mostly subsided for about a year. ive been hospitalized for it, i literally had to be at the absolute brink and go completely off the handle, ignoring school and my physical needs for it and still nobody took me seriously. i literally had screaming fits when i was in middle school where i just cried and cried and screamed and screamed if anybody got close to my room because i thought they were trying to hurt me. my parents handled this horribly and thought if they just screamed back that id be fixed. that worked as well as you could imagine. at the psych ward they told me it was anxiety and tried to give me some shitty ssris even though ive tried about every ssri and snri on the market and nothing has worked. i dont get them, maybe they think im a med seeker because i wasnt acting like an animal when i was in the hospital and around the doctors and nurses. anyway, kurt, i cant stop thinking about him, ive tried and tried, i stopped looking at the pictures and the note and listening to his music but i cant stop thinking about him. i dont know if im more obsessed with him or his death. i know its disgusting, but like i said i get no pleasure from thinking of his death. i think its a combination of some bizzare coping mechanism and desperately looking for closure and comfort. im not sure for what. that he didnt suffer? that hes not suffering anymore wherever he is in the afterlife? that it never happened? that its all fake and hes ok somewhere far away? that it really happened and its over? that if i do this i wont suffer anymore? maybe its everything. i cant grasp it, i never can. i never came to terms with it after my cousin molested me, i could probably never come to terms with something like this. i think im
looking for confirmation and closure that hes really gone but hes ok now because hes not in pain anymore. everybody else ignores me, i have barely any friends, ive spent my birthday alone or with my parents for the past 4 years. my boyfriend, 22m barely ever fucking talks to me, hes really sweet when he does but theres this constant lingering feeling like he just dosent care. hes in college and really busy so idk what to feel. dont even mention the age gap, thats not what im here to talk about and whatever your about to say about it i already know and have heard a thousand times before. ig it dosent matter bc i think about him about 100x less than i do kurt. he just dosent get me like he would. but im desprate for any affection, i stopped initiating it from my parents years ago. its not their fault, they have been through it all like me, and they love me as much as they are capable of, they are just as sick as me, but its almost worse because instead of constantly evolving and morphing, for better or for worse, like i do, they are completely stuck in their own ways. never changing, never getting worse but never getting better, well thats not completely true. with meditation my mom has gotten better over the years. my mom has bi polar disorder which heavily effected me as a child. i was stuck with her for the majority of it because my dad was in jail for beating her infront of me for most of it. he has npd and can never be wrong. ex con, multiple felon, drug charges, breaking and entering, violent crimes, the whole nine yards. he ""turned his life around"" and now makes a bunch of money hes racist now and has been clean for years but honestly id still take being stuck in that little warehouse with no bathroom door, a single matress and no furniture, malnourished and miserable while my mom tormented me as much as she loved me, a hundred times before id spend my childhood with my father. if i did id have probably killed myself way before id make it to this point. i still love both of them, i cant really fully blame them in a lot of ways they were sicker than i am. i dont know what to do with myself. i cant tell them. i cant ask for help, theyll put me back in the psych ward, treat me like an animal  and wont even help me. ill fail school if i go back. im already behind with a referall for not showing up to school because of my current state. the pills they gave me do nothing but make me worse. i need sedatives. i dont even want them to abuse them. i just want to feel ok. i genuinely get fits of anxiety so bad i cant sleep, cant move, cant talk, cant breathe. and they wont give me anything but fucking ssris that wont do anything. nothing works. a small amount of weed works but of theyd never give that to me for obvious reasons. i feel so stuck. i dont know what to do. this feels like the end but ive said that a hundred times before. they made me leave my best friend, it was probably for the best because that school environment degraded my health like acid eating through wood floors. but she was the only person who understood me even a fraction of what kurt cobain would. i feel like i cant live without her, and i guess im
not. i just hope i wake up and this was just a delusion from the meds, that im not really as sick as i am and that these new meds are just making me paranoid of something thats not real.

1jh97pp,2025-03-22T15:07:18,"Help me help her

We (FF/49&45) have been together for 11 years, 8 of them married. We’ve been through lots of ups & downs life wise but never really relationship wise, we never had a reason to fight or argue, we calmly discussed our problems. We always got along wonderfully, we never stopped going on dates, writing each other sweet notes, chores are ~50/50 depending on who has more time & energy. 
About a 1 ago we started arguing every now & then but it resolved quickly until the arguments repeated again & again,we never really resolved the cause.. mostly issues with jealousy, being afraid I’ll leave her for someone else. Starting with her suddenly getting jealous & seeing everyone I’m close with as trying to get between us, no reason behind it apparently, on the way to a dinner party we argued & when we arrived I went to another friend & left her to go alone, I realize I should’ve handled this more calmly & I apologized for getting louder & leaving, since then it’s not really the same anymore, I don’t know if she got scared or anything, she knows Im not violent, I didn’t scream at her, I know she hates that, but I think she sees small issues as an argument already& getting upset as getting angry.  

She has a history of abusive relationships,went no contact with most family, she was diagnosed with cptsd/gad, battled addiction , suicidal thoughts,all before we met. It was never a problem for our relationship in my eyes, she was always more or less worried it would affect our relationship. Jealousy might have something to do w/ her body dismorphia which I think has been around since the jealousy started. She jumped from one diet to another from time to time. 
When I ask her what’s wrong she either says nothing’ ‘I’m just not feeling well’ ‘I don’t wanna talk about it’ when I ask her friends they say they don’t know, maybe a depressive episode which has happened in the past: she stopped talking to me told me it’s nothing, until a nervous breakdown, I supported her through therapy and everything seemed to be going well, after that we got married, bout two years in a similar episode, but resolved quickly. 

We barely talk sometimes, if we do we argue. Few days we actually act like a couple, I try not to ruin those moments by not mentioning anything about these issues.
I usually do her hair/nails, she asks me to do it, we make put a time, but then tells me she doesn’t feel like it anymore, I make breakfast, plan dates, try to talk to her, nothing from her side, she barely eats some days, she goes to bed at 7pm sometimes and spending much more time in bed.. I have no idea how to save our relationship. I think she thinks  I already decided for myself I’m gonna divorce anyway & there’s no point in doing anything about it. I’m willing to go to any therapy she wants, I suggested couples therapy she said ‘you don’t believe in that anyway’ I said that in the very beginning to a friend, idk how she even remembers that. She said ‘you’ll leave me anyways’ 

When I asked her best friend she said ‘maybe a depressive episode, please stay with her’  (To her friends she seems quite normal, despite being more depressed, she talks to them laughs w/ them, they go out together. ) What if it’s worse than that, last time it was her mom passing away, I would know if someone else passed away, what if it’s a bad diagnosis? Or hers?

It bothered her that I work longer or stay in the car for a while, when she told me that I came home early the whole week but we barely talked & spend the rest of the day in different rooms, following week I worked longer again she complained I don’t wanna come home to her, I told her whats the point if she ignores me, she said nothing & left. Half my friends are apparently flirting with me and wanting to date me, one she even titled as a competition to her. 

For everyone suspecting she cheated, I’d put my hand in fire, she’s the most loyal person I know.   I want to help her but I can’t if she doesn’t want any help or can’t even tell me what’s wrong..
How do I talk to her..

Big big trigger warning for SH and hallucinations

So I've been in therapy for over half of my life (I'm 20) and I feel like I've gotten nowhere. I do understand that due to trauma, I have been masking a majority of my life. Autism was what started the masking habit but since I'm away from my abusers and am now in a stable place everything is falling apart. I've had a diagnosed ""anxiety disorder"" since I was 12 but it's gotten so much worse. I feel I've developed agoraphobia with how bad it is for me to even think about leaving my home. I get rushed with all of the things that can go wrong. It genuinely feels like if I leave, I'll die. I go into panic mode almost immediately. I won't leave unless absolutely necessary and even then it's insanely difficult.

 I've also noticed a habit of passively hurting myself. I'll hit my knees, purposefully run into things, even scratching my hands and neck to the point of bleeding. I think it's an anxiety thing but it's genuinely out of control. Sometimes these things are joined by intrusive thoughts of causing harm to myself. For example, if I'm doing the dishes and I see knives I have to walk away and stop myself from purposefully fileting my hands. Or stabbing myself. Wanting to throw myself infront of cars. Even trying to drown myself once on purpose. It's gotten harder and harder to stop these urges and I'm genuinely scared. I don't want to die and I don't want to hurt myself.

On top of that I just don't feel real. I think part of those urges is the need to feel something. Like assure myself that I am real. I feel like I'm operating a mech suit that I have no control over most of the time. It doesn't help when I see figures in the corner of my eyes and calling my name. Sometimes it's more than that. The hallucinations are what scare me the most because this makes it so difficult to be up front with my therapist. I've tried so hard to talk about these things with her but my body shuts down. It's like my brain is screaming for help but my body says no. I am my own enemy.

I've only ever been misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 14 as a placeholder diagnosis. The only solid things on my chart are anxiety and depression. How can I bring this up with my therapist? What might be causing these feelings and urges? What avenues of research should I look in to? Please anything will be helpful. I'm only able to get this out because I'm copy/pasting this from a Google doc and not actually speaking.

I struggle since almost 5 years. My dad is horrible, my mom messes with my mind and I dont know what to think of her anymore. Both of them ruined me. 

I went to therapist in january, I realized I cant handle it all on my own and Im just too tired.

 Like a week ago I accidently told them in an argument that I wanna die and they reacted poorly. They yelled and threathened with adoption and mental hospital. Also said that ""I have no reason to feel this way"" and ""they didnt raise me like this."" I didnt tell my therapist about my suicidal thoughts and SH cause Im scared shes gonna tell them and Im scared of their reaction. But theyre gonna see my SH scars in the summer. I went too deep and theyre not gonna fade soon or even ever. I dont want them to know.

Yesterday they wanted to talk with me. Turns out my mom read last page of my diary. I planned suicide and talked about it a bit there, that Im done and cant do this anymore etc. Im still trembling and my stomach hurts since she told me this. I cant believe she invaded my privacy like this. She also called my therapist to tell her this. I have a session in 3 days and she definitely will mention it.

 I dont know what to do. Really. I just want to die more now, I feel so helpless. The closest psychward is 40 mins from me, and the opinions on the website are scaring me. I dont think I wanna go there. Idk if theres any other option. I wish I could just die, really. But now they know, Im scared to do anything. And Im scared they will invade my privacy again. I have no one to talk to about this, no one to support me, so I cant feel better and Im just stressing about it all the time. I really dont know what to do, Im lost.

1jh3a4d,2025-03-22T08:42:07,"Am I depressed or just lazy?
I'm not sure what it is, but I'm conflicted between the word depressed and lazy. I don't know if I'm overexaggerating and sadly I have to express this on a reddit post since it's easier than expressing it to a person face to face. For many years, I've felt unmotivated to complete my school assignments. I WANT to do good, but I just feel a sense of hopelessness and also don't find a point in doing anything anymore.

Anyone else just feel completely lost all the time? Like there's some kind of solution to everything that you haven't found? A key to all of this? I realize there's probably no such thing, I know some people eventually end up becoming spiritual or finding god or something like that but I'm really not like that, so perhaps I need to adapt to the saying ""there is no purpose"" and try to adapt to that, I agree with it despite not feeling very comfortable with it 

I guess for me, if someone asked me the purpose is living a life without regrets and guilt, I know that no matter who you are,no matter what you've done in life, how successful you are, how rich etc, in our deathbed we're gonna gave regrets and guilt, my goal is to reduce those as much as possible, knowing how painful death is, my goal is to make it less painful.

A little info about me, I am 19 , I have chronic pain, I have been diagnosed with depression, a non specificied personality disorder, I have no degree, no job, nothing 

I have hobbies, I'm not extremely passionate about anything really, never have been, I wouldn't want to do any of my hobbies as a job, so everything seems like a dead end in my life and how I'm seeing things

I am a virgin, I have never fallen in love or been in a relationship, I am a porn addict, I am fat, and constantly suicidal.

I'm the definition of a loser, I don't mind, I'm just being realistic, I like being realistic even if it hurts.

What's not realistic, for me at least, is finding a job that will torment me physically and mentally, something I don't care about at all, just to say "" I have a job"" to people and live a basic normal life, have a family and all that typical bs. I get many comments like this, telling me to just go out, find a woman, have sex, get a job, get money, go on with life, to me that's just ignorance, what my whole family tree has been doing, and what comes out of it eventually, pain, guilt, regret.

1jgoynd,2025-03-21T20:15:54,"Seeking Advice on Brain Screening Tests for Paranoia, Negative Thinking, and Social Isolation
Hi everyone,

I’m reaching out for advice regarding my 32-year-old brother, who has been struggling with severe negative thoughts, paranoia, compulsive lying, extreme jealousy and holding grudges for over 12 years.  His behaviour has seemed to worsen over the years. When he talks, he appears very delusional and out of touch with reality, and usually is hating on others - friends, family. He stays in this zone constantly. He refuses to acknowledge that anything is wrong and doesn’t understand how deeply his actions are affecting those around him, particularly my parents. 

He lacks good friends, hobbies, passions, a sense of responsibility, or personal growth, and has no meaningful relationships. His expectations from others and life are often unrealistic. He tends to take rather than give, believing that my father, mother, and I dislike him and don’t want him to succeed, and that no one is on his side. He feels as if the entire world is against him. His mind constantly feeds him these distorted stories, and it’s challenging to change his perspective. He spends all day in his room, isolating himself. He recently had a heart attack (he’s just 32), which we think might be linked to his long-term marijuana (or even hard drugs) use over the past decade.

We’ve been very patient with him, just listening to him without challenging his views because if we try to explain that his thinking is skewed, he becomes very angry. He also continues to insist that he has no mental health issues and that everything is fine. As a family, we are blessed to have each other, and despite everything, my brother is a beautiful human being and has a lot of potential. He’s just a victim of his own mind, and his thoughts and fears overpower him. We desperately want to help him break free from this cycle.

Given these concerns, I’m looking into potential brain screening tests to help identify any neurological or physical causes for his behaviour, any potential mental disorder. I’m especially interested in tests that don’t require him to verbally engage with his thoughts or emotions, as he’s extremely resistant to talking about his mental health. Is there any such test available? 

If anyone has experience with similar situations, or can recommend which tests might be most useful in this case, I would really appreciate your advice. Additionally, if you have any suggestions on how to bring positive change into his life or support him in breaking the negative thought patterns, it would be incredibly helpful. 

Thank you so much for your support and any insights you can offer. Never giving up on him or losing hope.

I(M) am currently 23 years old from India . I want to talk to you about a my traumatic experiences that still haunt me, even though these things last happened a few years ago.

I had a traumatic childhood as I was judged by literally all people that matter to me the most (School friends, teachers and parents). Let me give you the whole story -

The story begins when I was in school . I was mostly a shy guy who had no fights with everyone in school, had many friends , never had a fight and almost no rivalry with everyone. STILL I WAS TREATED AS IF I WAS A TERRORIST at my school. Whenever a teacher entered the classroom , she would start yelling with me and many of them would remove me from the class as soon as they entered (Even if I had done nothing at all).

Soon my friends found out that they could bully me anytime. And they did so a lot of times. I was also made a scapegoat of the class. If anything got stolen, broken or damaged , everyone would point their fingers at me. This went on for almost 10 years. BUT THIS IS NOT HE WORST PART AT ALL.

When I was in 4th standard, I was told at my face by a teacher that I was abnormal and that I had some sort of different brain than others. She also sometimes called me mad. I had really started to think that it really was the case. The reason behind this behaviour was that I was scoring bad marks in the exams. 

Soon they contacted my parents and told them the same thing and advised them to show me to a psychiatrist - not once but twice , the psychiatrist told me that 'I WAS PERFECTLY FINE , MY BRAIN WAS PERFECTLY NORMAL'.But it as too late till then , I was deeply convinced that I had some sort of problematic or abnormal brain , as I was bombarded with such statements at my school for years. I still remember crying in my mother's lap convincing her that I am perfectly fine (For days). 

My mother then became friends with one of my friend's mother, who was told the same things as my friend too was scoring bad marks in school. 

It was too late till then, I was treated like a mad man by many teachers , constantly bullied my my teachers and friends, and was the only one who feared even going to school. 

Some of my friends still recall these events that took place with me in school and remind me about how bad everyone treated me in school.

I had such a mental toll of these things , that I had lost all confidence by then and had several mental breakdowns in even after school and still have some right now, even after so many years. The problem was that all these things did not happen to me rarely , these happened with me on a daily basis!!!!!! Even if I know that I am perfectly fine, there still is a part of my brain, convinced that I am different. 

Fun fact - NOW I AM ONE OF THE TOPPERS IN MY CLASS , WHEN PURSUING MASTERS DEGREE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE........

Whenever I even think of these events , I have mixed emotions of fear, anger, anxiety, it is as if the entire world has freezed.",truma im currently 23 years old india want talk traumatic experiences still haunt even though things last happened years ago traumatic childhood judged literally people matter school friends teachers parents let give whole story story begins school mostly shy guy fights everyone school many friends never fight almost rivalry everyone still treated terrorist school whenever teacher entered classroom would start yelling many would remove class soon entered even done nothing soon friends found could bully anytime lot times also made scapegoat class anything got stolen broken damaged everyone would point fingers went almost 10 years worst part 4th standard told face teacher abnormal sort different brain others also sometimes called mad really started think really case reason behind behaviour scoring bad marks exams soon contacted parents told thing advised show psychiatrist twice psychiatrist told perfectly fine brain perfectly normalbut late till deeply convinced sort problematic abnormal brain bombarded statements school years still remember crying mothers lap convincing perfectly fine days mother became friends one friends mother told things friend scoring bad marks school late till treated like mad man many teachers constantly bullied teachers friends one feared even going school friends still recall events took place school remind bad everyone treated school mental toll things lost confidence several mental breakdowns even school still right even many years problem things happen rarely happened daily basis even know perfectly fine still part brain convinced different fun fact one toppers class pursuing masters degree computer science whenever even think events mixed emotions fear anger anxiety entire world freezed,3,2,0,Neutral,Low

Hi everyone,
I’m really struggling right now and would appreciate any support or advice.

My boyfriend (6 months together) has been showing signs of depression for a while. He’s also grieving the loss of his best friend, which hit him very hard. In the beginning, our relationship was full of love, affection, and emotional closeness. He often told me how safe he felt with me, how much I meant to him, and how I helped him feel better — even during hard moments.

Over the past few weeks, he started pulling away. He was more distant, less responsive, sometimes affectionate, but also cold or flat. It felt very confusing. He told me he was “acting weird” and I could feel his guilt — like he knew he was hurting me but didn’t know how to stop it.

Now, for the past few days, he’s gone completely silent. He read my last message (which was kind and gentle), but hasn’t responded. He asked me before to stop messaging, and I respected that, but I’m scared. I don’t want him to feel like I’m abandoning him, especially now.

I know he’s not well. I know he probably misses me too — he just doesn’t know how to handle love right now. I just don’t know what to do. Should I keep giving him space? Should I check in? I’m not angry, I just don’t want him to feel alone.

Any thoughts or similar experiences would really help.

My bf of a year is going through hell at the moment. Without being too personal, his ex wife is making his life hell, work doesn't pay well and his manager is on his case all the time, grief, car problems, financial problems, health problems. It doesn't end.  
He's told me he's severely depressed.  
I've tried to be a supportive partner but he needs a lot of space. He's irritable, snappy, short. Has no desire to do anything. When I talk to him, or try to, it always turn into some kind of fight. Or he will say he doesn't have the patience for it.

The past few days have been really rough for him. His ex wife forbid him from seeing his children and he spiralled.  
I talked to him, and he told me he wasn't in the mood to talk to anyone. So I gave him the space he asked for.  
Two days later I reconnected with him. He spiralled and accused me of giving him the silent treatment. I explained that it wasn't the case and he accused me of gas-lighting him.  
During the day, he started multiple micro fights over anything and everything. Everything I said, turned into a mini fight.  
Responding, another mini fight. I felt like I couldn't win no matter what I did or say. At the end of the day, he told me I wasn't taking accountability and he felt like I wasn't listening to him.

So I stopped answering to his messages, I was drained. He showed up at my apartment that night and he apologized. Held me and he cried. We talked and we decided to stay together.

After that day, he said he wasn't sure about us anymore. That I wasn't a good partner. 

When we started dating, he told me he's the kind of person to self sabotage and that if our relationship were to turn to shit, it would be his fault.

I can tell right now he's in self sabotage mode. Pushing people away. Especially me who is the closest to him.

I can also tell he's spiralling and want to be loved. But that I'm doing is contributing to his depression.

Is this feeling one cast by my own eyes whenever I look into a mirror, or shame I feel every time those important to me look into my eyes, I know that im ugly, lazy, selfish, two faced, a horrible friend, an introvert, unmotivated, depressed, angry, addicted, and fake. Yet it’s as if my heart cant handle it and my mind creates falsehoods to tell me im good enough, I lie to myself and to friends pretending that im something im not, I derive satisfaction from the way others people perceive me and that alone, yet somehow the way I see myself overpowers what anyone tells me. I always feel deep down that no matter who it is that they secretly think negative things of me. I can’t help but feeling empty, it never improves, never gets better, it only gets worse every time someone tells me things that I want to hear yet im not ready for. How many friendships, how many things do I have to do wrong before the motivation to improve hits my ears. How many times do I have to betray myself and corrupt my morals until I feel satisfied with the image in my mirror. I cant stand to look at myself. I tell myself im happy, that im content, and I’ve gotten pretty good at feining my mental state infront of people. I smile, yet It’s always a mask, to pretend that im something im not. I hate myself, I truly cant say theres a single thing that I like about myself. I’m stuck, I keep coming back to my pond the second I catch a view of the ocean. I enclose myself in my digital encounters, in the comfort I can only find hidden behind a screen. My parents were always right, it's my damn phone. I’ve become so entranced in this person I want people to think I am that I fail to ever improve myself in any way. I need help, and im not sure what that means, therapy fails to help me, drugs fail to help me, I only feel true comfort and safety behind the wall of a screen. A moment in time where I dont have to be myself, or I can confide in the fact that im not truly happy. I keep betraying people to try and pull myself out of the pit of dissatisfaction im in. Even in moments where the consequences have no comparable worth to what ill lose I take it. I'm drowning, chained down by the subconscious image I make of myself. I need a life raft, even one that will sink shortly after. I get stuck in moments, whether I think it or not my minds always begging someone for help. If I even get a hint of affection I lose my moral compass. I look for a way to take that life raft so I can save myself the burden of losing myself to my emotions. I’ve ruined far too many friendships with my mentality. My mind, its constantly stabbing me with these thoughts, hoping someone notices enough to get me help, to offer a hand, to carry me out of this hole that I keep digging myself into.

TW: brief mention of MMC

My husband and I have been together for 4 years and married for 5. We are currently on our third attempt at having a baby after two previous losses. My husband has been on a constant downward spiral mentally since just before our first loss; loss of interest, increasing loss of appetite, increasingly frequent and intense emotional breakdowns (crying, screaming, begging, etc.), fatigue, chronic anxiety, paranoia, self-sabatoge, etc. He tried therapy two years ago when I found a therapist for my depression and chronic anxiety, but found no solace or support in her. He thinks the concept of finding another therapist would be pointless. He has lost several friends the last year or two and he feels like every relationship he has except for ours is shallow, like he can't rely on literally anyone because no one cares. We are incredibly close-knit and any attempt to try to break him of this co-dependency leads to him having a panicky breakdown, certain I'm leaving him or don't love him. I'm pregnant now and I simply can't support him to the degree he needs - in fact, my mood swings are so bad that I snap at him before I can stop myself when he is in his low lows.

1jie8dd,2025-03-24T01:29:30,"Am I really depressed or just being lazy and exaggerative?
I don't know if this is the right sub to go to but at this point I don't have many options. 

I have been feeling being ""depressed"" lately. When I say lately I mean for a couple of months I think. I've lost track of it. I think my situation is sort of uncommon. As of writting this, I am in my first year of college and still live with my parents. However, my parents are ""seperated"" (not divorced, they never married) and we still live in the same household along with my 2 sisters. One is in 5th grade and the other is in special education 3rd grade. Everyday is full of stress, as my father every now and then ignores my mother in matters for my sister. Also, he has put my mother in over thousands of dollars in financial debt because he stole her information to open credit cards. Recently, the court agreed that my mother has weekdays and my father has weekends. My father is out of the state for 3 weeks straight for his work and has put the stress of taking care of my sisters on my mother and I. Keep in mind, she does not have a job due to her taking care of my sisters and dropping me off to college. (My dad has done many other things to my mom, but that would be 2 paragraphs on its own)

I can't do this anymore, it been since my birth they were together, not together, together, and not together again. I feel like a burden, I don't take care of my hygene as often anymore, my college work is falling behind, I can't keep up with my room, I haven't changed my bedsheets in months, I haven't brushed in weeks, I eat like I am starving, then I eat like I'm full all the time, I hate that I talk to my mom like my dad, I hate I don't wake up on time for college which makes my mom late for her classes, I don't help around the house because my bum ass is lazy, my sleep schedule is abismal. I feel like nothing is real, but maybe because I don't get much sleep.

Yes, I have been thinking about SH, and its very vivid. With the amount of stress my mom deals with, I don't want to talk about this with her. And if I tell a professional about this, they might admit me to somewhere and get my mom and I into more debt and I fall behind more on other things. However, because of this she gives me talks about how im lazy and need to treat my college like a job and ""no wonder you're failing math with the amount you sleep like that."" She says these types of things alot, and I think she might be right. Maybe I am just lazy, maybe I am taking it too far and its just a ""cop out"" to stop doing my responsibilties. Another reason I think im just being lazy is that when I'm at campus, I am the opposite of this. I am friendly and chill, I laugh and have a good time. I still love to play videogames as its one of the few things that still give me joy. Am I just pretending? Am I not depressed becuase I am a bit self aware and still have hobbies?

1ji7b0n,2025-03-23T20:21:43,"Anyone Know How To Start Recuperating From Long Periods of Depression?
My first depression happened in about 2010. Since then I've had periods of severe depression, periods of light depression and periods where I wasn't depressed.

I think I'm currently in the longest unbroken period of depression though. Started in 2020 as severe depression, turned into light depression at the end of 2022, and then turned back into severe depression at the end of 2023 and has been severe ever since.

Anyway, I say all this because I've also recovered from depression several times now. But I feel like each time I've done it, it has been harder than before. Taken more effort and it has been harder to make that effort.

At this point, like 6 depressions in and after being consistently depressed for like 4 years, I feel like I literally just no longer have the energy to get out of it. A lot of the time I just feel like I can't do anything else except passively accept my circumstances. Because I no longer believe it can get better, and I just don't have the energy left to recover.

It's like periods of drought. You can store up water and food for when a drought hits. But each drought you have to use some. And if a lot of droughts happen one after the other or last very long, the storage spaces for the water and food are gonna be drained. And so how do you survive then? How do you recover?

I feel like I'm at that point nowadays. And I'm not sure how I can change it.

Is there anyone here who...

1. Knows what I'm describing and has experienced it?
2. Managed to get out of it and start rebuilding their life? If so, how?",anyone know start recuperating long periods depression first depression happened 2010 since ive periods severe depression periods light depression periods wasnt depressed think im currently longest unbroken period depression though started 2020 severe depression turned light depression end 2022 turned back severe depression end 2023 severe ever since anyway say ive also recovered depression several times feel like time ive done harder taken effort harder make effort point like 6 depressions consistently depressed like 4 years feel like literally longer energy get lot time feel like cant anything else except passively accept circumstances longer believe get better dont energy left recover like periods drought store water food drought hits drought use lot droughts happen one last long storage spaces water food gonna drained survive recover feel like im point nowadays im sure change anyone 1 knows im describing experienced 2 managed get start rebuilding life,4,3,0,Positive,High

1jhnypp,2025-03-23T02:21:54,"How True Is It That Smoking Makes Depression Worse ?
Been dealing with depression for like 8 yrs now and funny enough I started smoking around the same time I got diagnosed. For me, smoking’s always been an escape, just something to fill the void. At least it gives me that temporary chill, even if it’s all in my head. Can’t say the same for antidepressants tho. Those just slowed me down, made me gain weight, and honestly made shit worse.

Since this depressive episode been dragging on for years, feels like my brain’s fried. My mind’s always foggy, memory’s trash, and sometimes even forming a sentence feels like a damn struggle. I know depression itself can do that, but could smoking be making it worse? I read somewhere that it messes with o2 flow to the brain, weakens neurons, and slows down thinking, but no clue if that’s real or just more bs theories.

Tbh when it comes to mental health, I lost faith in docs and all that traditional treatment shit. My experience with antidepressants was a disaster, and at this point, I trust real ppl’s experiences way more than whatever new study they push every few months.

So how true is it that smoking actually makes depression symptoms worse, like brain fog and focus issues? Cuz if that’s legit, I might need to rethink some things. My life’s already a mess thanks to this busted brain, and I just wanna fix whatever I still can.

ALL OF THIS I’M EXPLAINING IS TRUE. I just know it is. And if I did anything extremely wrong. Please advise that I am a fully changed person and I don’t do that type of stuff anymore.

Please provide me support & forgive me for all my past. And make me help move on. 🙏🏻 Please be nice to me. Everyone is so mean to me (including my parents) recently, and it’s been really difficult to get better & it’s also hard to get over it. ❤️‍🩹 

My father just abused me a few weeks ago & it’s very hard for me to move on from it. Also, I’m being transitioned into a new school. AGAIN!!!!! And I was already transitioned into a different school once & it’s happening again.

Many years ago, back in 2022/2023. I made an inappropriate joke about Nurse Bendy (from Moral Orel) calling her sexy & hot. I moved on from this. Please don’t get mad at me. This was a long time ago.

Someone doxxed my face, and people also made fun of me in a severely hurtful way. They’ve also made fun of me & also said something beyond NSFW about me that I cannot say on this subreddit.

I highly advise you to NOT look it up of what I’m talking about, and about Nurse Bendy. This is extremely serious.

They’ve also been using a lot of harsh language to me.

I’ve been having so many suicidal thoughts recently. There’s also a kid named Michael who hates me & always insulted me in a severely terrible way. There was also this one time where a group of guys on the street called me a lot of racist things & disgustingly awful things to me.

And there’s this one time where I got my legs kicked at the lunchroom by a girl named Angie & everyone laughed at me. I started crying. Literally.

Oh, and there’s this one time where I got insulted outside my old school, and he called me a “big a** forehead” which I don’t. Because I said to him that he says too much curse words (which is true, honestly.) and my crush Kaylee was sitting next to him. Which made me mad.

I got so frustrated at the fact that my crush Kaylee was gay. And despite being homeschooled, I still sent an apology letter that I was sorry for being a creep to her. I just didn’t know how to flirt with a girl.


My mom says that she’ll protect me. No matter the cost.


And that was all of it. I’m already grown now. So that happened back in the early 2020s, and the worst thing they could call me was a “man-child”. I am also even worse than Charlie Brown.

I used to be in university so people think I still am but I dropped out because smoking pot is the only thing that makes me feel like I’m not on the verge of sobbing 24/7 and I can’t stop smoking it no matter how hard I try because I don’t want to be alone with my thoughts. I’m pretty sure the only reason I haven’t had s*uicidal thoughts is because I love my two cats too much to leave them. On the outside I appear financially stable but I’ve been jobless basically for 14 months, I’ve had to leave/got let go three restaurant jobs before my three months were up because my depression got so bad - I couldn’t get out of bed to wash my hair, let alone go for a WALK.

I slept with a two men this year, and now I’m 7 weeks pregnant and miscarrying in a Province alone unable to tell either of them, and with no friends to help.

Hi Guys, as the title says, I am looking for 3 people with depression, who do not have a trigger in their environment (just lost a job, partner left etc), but suspect, it might come from their body. Of course we all have our problems and life is tough, but I am looking specifically for individuals who have been depressed since a long time and can't really figure out why. 

I am a nutritionist and have great results with treating depression through nutrition and lifestyle changes. I also include trauma and nervous system work, but mostly concentrate on the body, because 80% of serotonin is made in the gut and the microbiome plays a HUGE role. 

So I am looking for 3 individuals who are willing to work with me for a few months. You don't have to pay me, but if you have good results, please recommend me to others. 

You don't have to buy supplements from me (you might need some stuff, but can get that wherever it is convenient), but you might have to do some testing (blood, urine, stool) and be willing to give any diet changes your all and be serious about it (no worries, you will be well fed and taken care of).

we are going to have one/two appointments each month, maybe even in a group call and hopefully get you out of the darkness, into the light.

1jh0mm5,2025-03-22T05:37:06,"Depressed boyfriend turned toxic and I need to know if its normal
My boyfriend is battling depression. He has zero energy for any kind of social interaction. He doesn't want to work. Sleeps a lot. Is pushing me away when I want to help or stonewalling me.

His ex took him to court for a custody battle that is draining him emotionally and financially. She's forbidding him to see his kids. It's been difficult for him.

One thing about me and my bf, I've always told him he could be himself around me. No mask, no fakeness, just him communicating his feelings. 

Lately he's been toxic and projecting those emotions onto me.
The caring man he used to be is now rude to me.
Yesterday something happened and I called him. He told me to let him know the outcome of my misadventures the next day, that's today.

I texted him, asking if he was free for a call so I call and tell him what happened. He replied: Do I really give off the vibe right now that I want to talk with you? That's a serious question. I didn't reply.

Last week, we were talking and he was his usual sweet man. He told me he couldn't wait to see me. Said I love you. Really made me feel better.

Earlier this week I asked him what he wanted to do, he got upset saying he didn't remember saying we should hang out and told me I was making him feel crazy.
But two hours later he apologized, saying work is stressful and he's gonna make time for me.

When I was over to his place, he was sweet for an hour and then he out of nowhere started an argument about plans we made and he called me toxic for reminding him of the conversation we had. Asked me why I was at his house to spend time with him. 

Sometimes I will ask him what he's up to at night and he'll say things like: Being extremely uninterested in having a conversation.
Or Why are you trying to force a conversation?

Before being depressed he was never this rude to me. Ever.

Tonight, in the span on 5 mins, he told me he didn't wanna talk to me. When I didn't reply he went hello???? And 3 mins later: Amazing communication! This is why I push you away!!


I've been depressed myself before but I never projected my emotions like that or turned mean towards the person I love the most.

What's going on, why is he like that now?

1jgyn5i,2025-03-22T03:45:07,"I Think I Ruined My Bond With My Sister, and It’s Breaking Me 💔
I don’t know if I’m being overprotective, controlling, or just a brother who cares too much. But I think I messed up, and now my sister is distancing herself from me.

I’m 24M, and my sister is 21F. We used to be really close, but things changed in the past few months. She had a 3-month relationship, and after the breakup, she started having anxiety attacks. I was the one who supported her, and she told me she wouldn't date again. But now, she’s secretly chatting with someone again.

She hides her chats, deletes messages, and acts differently when I’m around. I tried talking to her and told her that she’s free to do whatever she wants, but I don’t want her dating again, at least not now. I reminded her of her past experience, but she just said, “It’s my life, my choice.” That hit me hard.

But here’s the thing—I’m not innocent in all this. I used to be overly protective, and yeah, I even invaded her privacy. I kept an eye on her, checked who she was talking to, and I’ve even tried hacking into networks to see her messages (which didn’t work). I thought I was doing it to protect her, but now I see how it must have felt like I was spying on her.

Now, she’s avoiding me. Today, we were sitting with our relatives, and the moment they left the room, she left too—on purpose. She doesn’t even ask me simple things like what to bring from outside when my dad tells her to check with everyone.

What hurts me even more is that whenever I ask her ""When will we talk?"", she just says ""We'll see"" and avoids answering directly. No matter what I ask, her response is always ""We'll see."" It feels like she doesn’t care anymore, or maybe she’s waiting for me to stop asking.

And the worst part? She’s not forgiving me. I’ve apologized, I’ve tried to talk things out, but she straight-up told me to ""stay away"" for now. It’s like she wants nothing to do with me.

I don’t know if she’s just mad at me, or if I’ve permanently damaged our bond. I know I made mistakes, but I did it out of concern.

At the same time, I’m dealing with my own problems—career uncertainty, health issues, and depression since I was 18. Everything feels messed up. I even started smoking again from the stress.

I don’t know what to do. Should I distance myself? Apologize again? Or just let things be? I feel like I’ve lost my sister, and I don’t know how to fix it.

I (23F) have always been a glass half-empty sort of person for as long as I can remember. I lack emotions and interest in things. For the past year or so, I believe this has increased. 

A bit of background: 

I’ve been aloof from my emotions ever since I was a child, perhaps this has something to do with my overly critical parents. I was (and am) an overachiever and people always have high expectations from me, which feels so trapping. I also suffer from self doubt and low confidence. This might be a good place to mention my parents have had poor health since forever, which adds to the pressure. 

I have been suicidal in the past during the time I was preparing for medical entrance exams, but that corrected itself once I cleared the exams.

I don’t have a great relationship with my parents, even now. I am the golden child/trophy child. While it does feel great to be bragged about, it sucks to know they know nothing about me as a person. 

Currently: 

I feel no interest in things. I don’t find the energy to do/try new things. I can’t seem to find the energy to socialise. I find it hard to make new friends. I can’t seem to find the energy to do special things for my loved ones. I don’t want to learn new things. I don’t want to think about anything. 
I’ve even lost my sense of humour.

I feel like I am 80 years old, even though I am really not this boring. 

I am not suicidal, and I don’t hate myself or my life, but I just can’t seem to be bothered to do anything. Like, absolutely anything. It’s almost like I am living on autopilot. 

I was wondering was this means? And what do you think I should do here on out?

but for some reason, after seeing more and more content about him, i started to feel this sort of anxious, depressed, and maybe even suicidal feeling. i realized that he isn’t real, and he never will be able to love me. i won’t be able to live in his “universe” and experience myself in his life because it’s just not possible. it hurt. and it caused me to spiral into a depressive episode in which i genuinely thought about killing myself because it hurt so much. i know it’s psychotic and stupid, and incredibly farfetched and crazy. but it’s how i felt. i was truly in so much pain. and i couldn’t tell anyone because i knew nobody would understand.

i began avoiding everything about the character. the video game they come from, the things about them, everything. even one small mention even remotely close to him would make my heart sink and ruin my day. i always think that he’s watching me too. watching me go to school, watching me eat, everything. i’m still so paranoid and obsessed with him, even though ive tried to remove this character from my online world. 

and ive tried therapy. ive tried to journal, workout, eat healthy, go on walks, limit screen time, read, do hobbies. ive done research on how to heal. and i havent. i still feel the same. i even have good friends in which i hang out with, and talk to in school regularly. i do my homework. everything. and still, he will not leave my mind. and every little thing reminds me of him. ive even tried asking chatgpt for gods sake 😭 and still, im attached, and everytime i think about him i am filled with depression and anxiety because i know that he won’t ever be with me. i have no idea what to do. it’s gotten so bad that i can’t imagine myself being in a real relationship because i’m scared they’ll play the game in which he comes from and i’ll become depressed all over again. that, and the fact that i don’t want anyone else but him. 

i don’t know what to do. please tell me there’s someone here who’s going through or has gone through something similar. im willing to give out my socials to people that want to help. i just want to be okay. please somebody help. i would also appreciate if there was no judgement either as this was one of the only places i felt safe enough to share. thank you for taking the time to read.

1jjm1lc,2025-03-25T16:28:05,"I feel selfish and like a failure. (Long, advice please?)
For the past 5 years I've been extremely depressed, and the thing is.. I dont even remember why. It seems as though my memory has deteriorated significantly, I can't remember much of anything other than the last year or two and even those are foggy. I can't remember most good memories I've had, only bad ones. And whenever those randomly resurface I feel even more hopeless. Years of my life, my early childhood I've forgotten. I suffer with severe social anxiety as well, to the point even leaving the house or going in public is a hassle and very scary. I feel bad because my parents have accommodated me a lot. When I was in school they would allow me to skip when I was having a bad day, and eventually took me out completely due to me not going at all and legal issues arisen. They don't make me do anything I dont want to, and I keep taking advantage of it and I can't seem to stop. I feel selfish, I don't take theirs or anybodys advice or help. and whenever my parents continue accommodating I only use it to keep laying in bed and doing nothing. I stay in bed all day either sleeping or being on social media, not being social of course. Only watching videos all day in bed. I only get out of bed to get something to eat and drink or use the bathroom, and the past few months I don't  even get up to do those. I don't shower for weeks at I time, and I won't brush my teeth or even brush my hair, causing knots and a lot of hairloss when I finally do. I'll only ever shower if I have to go somewhere, like the doctor or when I'm forced to go shopping with my parents. Because the thing is, I'm terrified of people's judgment, Whenever I'm out in public I hide myself especially because I'm really overweight due to my main coping mechanism being food, and when I'm sad I usually eat, and since I'm sad almost all the time I eat all the time, and eating all the time + rotting in bed all day doesn't keep you at a healthy weight. I hit 204 lbs when I was around 11 yrs old years ago, I haven't been on a scale for months now so I don't  know if I lost or gained anything. I feel like I've failed my parents, I've done nothing with my life and I can't even do mundane tasks whatsoever. I can't seem to want to get better anymore at this point, I'm scared for the future because I know I'll never get anywhere in life when I can't even get up and I can't regulate my emotions. I am tired all of the time, I do get happy, quite a lot. But I'm still depressed and no meds haven't worked long term, they would maybe work for a few weeks than stop. Any advice would be helpful, or even any responses to see if anyone else can relate.",feel selfish like failure long advice please past 5 years ive extremely depressed thing dont even remember seems though memory deteriorated significantly cant remember much anything last year two even foggy cant remember good memories ive bad ones whenever randomly resurface feel even hopeless years life early childhood ive forgotten suffer severe social anxiety well point even leaving house going public hassle scary feel bad parents accommodated lot school would allow skip bad day eventually took completely due going legal issues arisen dont make anything dont want keep taking advantage cant seem stop feel selfish dont take anybodys advice help whenever parents continue accommodating use keep laying bed nothing stay bed day either sleeping social media social course watching videos day bed get bed get something eat drink use bathroom past months dont even get dont shower weeks time wont brush teeth even brush hair causing knots lot hairloss finally ill ever shower go somewhere like doctor im forced go shopping parents thing im terrified peoples judgment whenever im public hide especially im really overweight due main coping mechanism food im sad usually eat since im sad almost time eat time eating time rotting bed day doesnt keep healthy weight hit 204 lbs around 11 yrs old years ago havent scale months dont know lost gained anything feel like ive failed parents ive done nothing life cant even mundane tasks whatsoever cant seem want get better anymore point im scared future know ill never get anywhere life cant even get cant regulate emotions tired time get happy quite lot im still depressed meds havent worked long term would maybe work weeks stop advice would helpful even responses see anyone else relate,1,0,0,Negative,High
1jjlzr2,2025-03-25T16:26:01,"I feel trapped in my own home
I live with my parents, unemployed, and I feel trapped in my own home. I’m constantly aware of being perceived, so my only escape is my room. But because of my depression and anhedonia, I’m often bored, will little to do besides go on my phone or play video games.

I’m fine with being around my mom and brother, but I can’t say the same for my dad. It’s not that he’s abusive or anything, I just can’t handle his lip smacking, mouth breathing, open mouth chewing, etc. 
90% of the time it’s awkward silence because we have nothing to talk about, so whenever he enters the living room, I end up hiding in my room again.

I have extremely bad social anxiety, and don’t have a drivers license. I can’t take the bus because of anxiety, and even if I could I don’t know where I’d go that wouldn’t drain/overwhelm me. I can’t even go grocery shopping with my mom without feeling anxious.

Usually I had 2-3 days home alone during the week where I could fully relax, but my dad fell during work and hurt his arm (not broken, I think just tore something). He’s been home for a week now, going to physical therapy and slowly recovering. But in this past week I’ve just been in my room, waiting for the day he goes back to work.

Now when it’s the day before he said he’d be back at work by, he’s saying his arm hurts too much and that he’s staying home tomorrow as well.

Obviously I’m worried about him and want him to get better, but I hate the possibility of hiding in my room for another week. I don’t even have any friends to go hangout with.


(TLDR: I’m living with my family, hate being perceived and hide in my room most of the time, can’t go outside because of social anxiety, I usually have 2-3 days home alone to relax but my dad hurt his arm and has been home for the last week, and just when I thought he’d be going back to work I find out he’s still not feeling well is staying home for however long)",feel trapped home live parents unemployed feel trapped home im constantly aware perceived escape room depression anhedonia im often bored little besides go phone play video games im fine around mom brother cant say dad hes abusive anything cant handle lip smacking mouth breathing open mouth chewing etc 90 time awkward silence nothing talk whenever enters living room end hiding room extremely bad social anxiety dont drivers license cant take bus anxiety even could dont know id go wouldnt drainoverwhelm cant even go grocery shopping mom without feeling anxious usually 23 days home alone week could fully relax dad fell work hurt arm broken think tore something hes home week going physical therapy slowly recovering past week ive room waiting day goes back work day said hed back work hes saying arm hurts much hes staying home tomorrow well obviously im worried want get better hate possibility hiding room another week dont even friends go hangout tldr im living family hate perceived hide room time cant go outside social anxiety usually 23 days home alone relax dad hurt arm home last week thought hed going back work find hes still feeling well staying home however long,1,0,0,Negative,Low

I'm a 21yo F, pretty good position in life otherwise. Studying to become a doctor. Not struggling academically. 

But adulthood hit me like a bomb. Since 3 years I've been through depressing times. Everything I do brings me guilt.

The thought of having my parents talk to me on call? Why'd they want to?

The eye contact with anyone? Oh shit I'm so sorry you had to see my face. 

Eating food? Do I even deserve this?

Asking for help when suicidal? Nobody deserves to hear this depressing stuff. Reddit is anonymous and helps me keep venting the pressure off and not blasting away.

I've still managed pass 3 years of my med school pretty much normally except the year 1 when I just couldn't understand what was happening. I asked for help back then. Idk if I got help or got scammed. I've probably taken every antidepressant in the books and my body is too sensitive to handle any of those side effects. I've been admitted so many times against my wishes. I've been through the horrors of ECTs against my will. Not 1 not 2 but 18 sessions. Since then I've had to pretend everything was more than normal and I was a very happy excellently performing student coping up with every damn thing. 

Today has been hard. Haven't been out of bed since like 8 hours. 2 days feeling like my breathing is so laboured.

1jjl5ho,2025-03-25T15:50:04,"im feeling very unalivable
as the topic title says im seriously considering suicide, i know life can always be better but let me explain

because i want my story to atleast be out there before i do or if i do

from the start i didnt have a good start my dad was disabled when i was relatively young along with a very alchoholic mom, my mom died from pancreas cancer and my best friend my sister moved out pregnant when i was ten'ish, so there was me, a cat (my family had a white cat) and my disabled dad who couldnt carry more then ten pounds maybie, yep a setup for success! our money situation was like this, my dads disabled check would cover rent while my survivors benefits check would cover food and bills aswell as transportation, my sister would help us when she can with her boyfriends family who didnt like us much so she could only do so much. growing up you can already assume i had huge anxiety and ptsd aswell as just being akward and hard to befriend but i did make friends, lets fast forward a bit past the time i got arrested for selling weed or put into continuation school as those are nothing to what comes up, my dad doesnt let me know i should be working by 18 and suprise suprise our survivors benefit check stops coming in which means guess what, my dad says yah lets get evicted and tells me to basically fuck off (he was on methadone for opiate abuse) but also crys and says sorry, when he couldve of use his rent check and helped me get working but nah he gave up, so my sister steps in and helps me secure a spot with this kind woman who for the sake of the story i will call jermima , jermima was cool and very nice which i fucked it up with how i became over the 18 years i lived in isolation, i robbed her, yep she took me in and stoled her weed cause i was hardcore addicted to it like a crackfean, i remember her going to work at 8 in the morning and i would literally creep into her room like a fucking stupid ass to steal from her when she took me in (made my rent 200 in california too..) so i fucked that up and had to beg my dad to move in with me again for maybie a chance to grow up and be an adult, he actually agreed. me and him moved to a more ghetto town but it was livable, my dad was on oxygen at this time so i had to do more for him but i didnt care, for a year i was his caregiver and did everything for him i could, i met a girl during this time and he also blew up his face (dont ask but basically him smoking a cig while on oxygen and not doing it right) so i was left with some options, continue being his caregiver unable to drive or past him on to my sister as i moved in with this girl, my girlfriends mom was schizophrenia though so that took alot of adjusting to get use to it , her coming into our room regularly, asking us what we are thinking and just overall being too selfish about us wanting space. she also 51/50ed me for just saying how a day sucked and i wanted to off myself (gen z humor) ontop of that for 3ish years we lived paying 800 but not every month, she was lowkey abusive but only mentally not physically, she demanded money and we would have to come up with it somehow and i know 800 was not much but for me and the girlfriend who wasnt working good jobs at the time that was our whole paychecks, so we where paying to live in a place to starve essentially and she wasnt willing to adjust it, her dad lived next door to us and was super nice but anytime we went over she would threaten us with eviction if we said anything that she was doing wrong essentially (actual words she said ""i want 800 this month cause yall didnt pay last month  and i want to go to vegas, thats my vegas money! also dont bother popsi (italian word for papa) he is old and if i hear yall did im kicking yall ass's out) she came back from the vegas trip winnerless and happy that she spent our hardworking money on gambling by the way, later that 3rd year she died from a car accident which sends my gf into shock and depression for months aswell as me in just utter hopeless ness, she was supposed to teach my girlfriend how to drive but left her with a car without any knowledge how to drive, after her death my girlfriends grandma developed stage 4 body cancer  aswell as what family i had left moving to another state leaving us with less help which made everything harder, her grandpa had to cremate her earlier this year actually and at the moment we have a 80 year old man in pain trying his damness to sell the house to leave us with some cash to start a lease on an apartment.......he is also making sure she knows how to drive before i do  which ill have to learn later (my dad didnt give me my birth certificate when  i was older and said he lost it) not cause i dont want to learn i would love to learn but without my certificate and a person to drive me there im stuck in this situation waiting for my gf to learn to drive to beable to, we have a month and half to move out of a house we lived in for 5 years and im trying to not throw up as we speak

This is the second time i am writing this because while i was writing SHE CAME IN TO ASK IF IM OKAY the first time.

The thing is, i tend to feel depressed every once in a while for no obvious reason at all. I have a great life. Great friends, a loving boyfriend and family, good grades; i couldn’t ask for anything better. But i have this weird connection to being sad. For example, i get weirdly obsessed and attached to stories about people that want to or have commit suicide, do drugs or having a terrible life in general but not in a way of empathy, it’s SO strange but i would like to be in their place.A good example of this is pelle ohlin, i will probably get hate for this but i think it’s one that many people know so it will help them understand me. Or i sit for hours and read r/suicide. And when i start getting in to a story like one of the above i begin to fall apart myself.

I go through this by listening to loads of music, i happed to love metal(especially black) and grunge, which my mother believes is extremely depressing and not good for me because i’m very musically dependant. I also sleep all the time and lock myself in my room. The above are not SO much different from what i do when i’m happy but it’s noticeable when they happen.


My mother is very very caring and right now more than any other time she keeps asking me if i’m okay. The “im tired” or “i have a headache” excuses are getting old. The thing is, this is DROWNING ME ALIVE. I know how to cope in these situations, i just need my time. Her asking me these questions all the time is just pushing me away from her and making me want to lock myself in my room even more or be outside so u can be away from her.


I know i sound so incredibly ungrateful but she is just making me feel guilty for existing. I have told her that but she ignores it. i don’t know what to do. Usually i pretend to be okay but that just doesn’t help progress at all. If i actually tell her the truth (that i’m sad for basically no reason) she will just get extremely sad and overreact . She has already got her own problems and i don’t want to add to that, so it’s not an option.

I was just diagnosed with Celiac disease a few weeks ago. I can't do it. Literally the only thing in life that brought me joy was food and going out to eat with people. I've been out to eat a few times since getting diagnosed and I had to sit and watch everyone else enjoy their food and mine is always gross and not even fully gluten free because I got sick afterwards. I have severe social anxiety and I can't make sure there's no cross contamination. Its so overwhelming I just can't do this. If I eat gluten I'll get super sick and it will eventually turn into cancer. I just can't do this shit. I wanted to go to culinary school, I love cooking.

I'm autistic and all my safe foods contain gluten. I'm so stressed out I just barely been eating. I cant even go to the grocery store. I don't want to get out of bed. I've been crying every day since I was diagnosed. I know its not a terrible disease, but its completely altered my life. I wanted to travel the world and try all different foods. That was my thing that was keeping me going. The social aspect is just gone. I don't want to be here anymore. Ive never felt so hopeless in my life. My coworkers are constantly bringing in food with gluten and asking me if I want some even though I've told them countless times I can't. My family thinks its not a big deal and that food isn't everything, BUT OTS NOT JUST FOOD. IM NOT SAFE ANYMORE. I cant eat anything!! Just seasonings on food can have gluten. Dressings. Medicine. Literally everything has gluten in it and I just can't be happy anymore.

I was already struggling really bad before this diagnosis. I was already hating my life. But now I just wish I was gone. I wish I could just disappear. I hate my life. I hate myself. I have so much shit wrong with me. My brain has always been defective, ive always been the odd one out because of who I am as a person. Atleast if I went out to eat with friends and family I'd seem normal. But now I stand out even more. I have to ask if they're sure they have gluten free options.

I’ve been struggling with my depression and some gut-wrenching anxiety recently. I was cursed at birth with *The Three Strikes(tm)* - autistic, depressed, and gay. I think about dying all the time, but even that just seems like a waste of time. Pointless, even. 

The main thing keeping me alive right now is an obsession with a man who doesn’t even know I exist anymore, let alone remember my name. So I’m kept alive with a faint hope in feelings that were entirely delusional in the first place. And for some reason I can’t let go and it just feels pathetic and humiliating. 

Like somehow he’ll know I feel the same way and be both repulsed and terrified. Or come find me and beat me up. 
And now I’ve realised I can’t even write about my own depression without talking about someone else lol. 

I try talking to other guys, focusing on my own life, trying to take my mind of it. But I just keep getting trapped inside my own head, constantly cycling through some sort of emotional self-flagellation.

Hi, 21M here.

I've been depressed for many years already. Been having suicidal thoughts for about 3 years, and it has gotten worse recently. I'd say I've never had any ambitions, the only thing I cared about was finding someone special and having as much fun as possible.

Any kind of problem or inconvenience affected me a lot, and I realised I wasn't having as much fun as I was being hurt.

My girlfriend broke up with me about half a year ago, and I realised that I don't really enjoy romantic relationships.

I've finished my studies a few days ago, and I realised that if I'm going to be working on a job for so many years of my life, with no ambitions, no goals and no convictions, my life should might as well end right now.

  
That is why I'm asking. What motivates you to live? Where do you find that joy that keeps you living through everything?

  
I want to read everyone. Both people that didn't lose their will to live in the first place and had something to do, search for or accomplish, and people who were lost and found that one thing (or multiple things) that saved them.

I experienced loneliness for 6 years and the initial cause was because I was bullied in middle school, fortunately for the remaining 2 years at school I was not bullied because of covid.

I started looking for new friends, I was really happy to be friends with them, especially because they had the same interests as me, but unfortunately it didn't last long. After 6 months with them I decided to leave because at that time I was depressed and suddenly I isolated myself for 5 months.

And when I entered high school I tried something similar by joining extracurriculars that I liked, we had the same interests but the problem was I didn't feel connected to them. And again I decided to leave after 1 year of joining them. After that I tried to find other communities that suited my interests, but it didn't feel the same as before.

1jjfgfh,2025-03-25T10:33:21,"Self-harm relapse after over two years clean
Everything is just sad, on top of my depression itself. This isn’t a post about bereavement, but for context there was a death in my family and will be another likely very soon (both people being older, extremely dependable female figures in my life). I think the reason I ended up here is because my closest friend has flaked out on a phone call to catch up for four months now. I moved to a new country by myself last year, so I am a 12-hour flight away from all of this. English is my native language, but I speak a different language 24/7 here and feel like I can’t accurately express myself and my feelings to anyone. I’m not even sure I have anyone here I would feel comfortable trying that with, anyway. And because of my friend flaking on this phone call, I’ve been bottling and bottling all my feelings because they have nowhere to go. I have no one to hash things out with. 

It was also my birthday a little over a week ago, and every time my birthday comes I get so depressed. I never do anything for it so I don’t know why it’s even worth getting depressed about, but 24 is feeling really, really bad so far. 

Also, I confessed to a friend and got rejected. I guess I liked her more than I thought because this just pushed me over the edge and all of a sudden every sad thing in my life felt huge. She was very nice about it and it’s difficult because we’re both girls, so no bad blood towards her at all, but this was the first time in my life where I had the courage to be honest with someone about my feelings. For it to end badly is pretty crushing. I tried to follow my heart and lost a friend instead. I’m not sure how friendships recover after something like this, and I’m not sure I even want it to because it will probably just hurt to be around her. I’m in tears typing this because all I keep thinking is how I liked her so, so much more than I thought and how well we fit together and how I ruined it. 

There are so many other little stupid things that just weigh on me. The one hobby I have (good for stress relief) involves lots of work, and it’s going really badly right now/I’m making laughable progress, if any. I had major health issues a few years ago (I had a stroke, lol) and my brain is different and my vision is different and my heart has a piece of metal in it now and sometimes I think I can feel it (100% pure paranoia). I can’t get over this intense, teenage desire to be naturally beautiful, which I’m not. I’m an introverted homebody to the point of detriment: I spend 90% of my free time alone at home, but I’m not even enjoying it because I feel this stress/pressure/shame that I should be outside doing things instead. 

I’ve spent over a year in therapy and am disappointed in myself. All that work, all that money, just to fucking relapse after over two years? I’m actively taking medication, too. Apparently it didn’t make a difference. I want to be really upset, but deep down I don’t think I am. Self-harm is a coping mechanism that works for me. It makes my heart stop hurting and makes me breathe and gives my body head-to-toe waves of euphoria.

1jjfjw0,2025-03-25T10:41:01,"How can I cope until I can see a therapist?
I'm 32f and have pretty severe fibromyalgia with ibs and anxiety/depression. I've been only very recently diagnosed with fibro, and the meds I'm on kind of helped with my stomach. I'm only sick about half the week now, though the pain and other symptoms are nearly constant. I flair up when I'm anxious, and when I put physical stress of almost any kind on myself. I'm allowed 10 minutes max of low impact exercise only because I hurt and get dizzy pretty bad now a days. It probably wouldn't have gotten to this point if we'd been able to figure out what was going on years ago, but hindsight is 20/20. This is a struggle for many reasons.

One, I hate hurting and getting sick. I'm tired of the constant aches and pains and trying not to be sick. My immune system is shot so I have to be careful around others. I can't do much without hurting so bad I want to crawl unto a hole.

Two, I am entirely dependent on my parents. I live in a house my grandmother owns, but they pay for everything else from food to electricity. I get far too sick to work, and the doctors have told me not to until I'm not at risk for making myself worse. Of course this means I'm a huge burden on my family, and I'm constantly afraid of them feeling used. My last two employers both told me my health issues were all in my head, and gaslit me so bad that I'm terrified they are right or that my loved ones agree. 

Three, I used to be very independent. I like going out, I like doing things physically, and I love people. I miss working. It's been three years and I'm extremely cut off from the outside world physically. I miss making my own financial decisions, but because I wasn't diagnosed until recently- I was denied disability. Even with my parking placard and cane, I find myself hurting too much to do activities I enjoy.

This has culminated over the years in intensive feelings of negativity towards myself. I have to constantly fight myself to not dwell on those thoughts. To tell myself my loved ones care about me and know I appreciate them, love them, and don't feel like I'm faking it or using them. It's a huge issue I cry to them about off and on, though I try not to make them deal with my emotions on top of their own and the cost of everything. It's a lot for them, and it's been years. On top of that, I have a hard time wanting to be alive. This isn't to say I want to hurt myself, by no means do I want to experience additional pain nor do I want to inflict mental anguish on my loved ones. But all my health issues have made me feel like it might be better if I died so I'd stop hurting and my family wouldn't be burdened. I fight hard to ignore these feelings and protect myself from them, but it's hard. I know I don't have it that bad compared to others, but I'm apparently not as strong as I'd hope. 

Which leads me to this week. I fought with my father. I won't go into all the details, but it was uncharacteristic of him to blow up and not be able to verbalize why he was so mad in the first place. I sobbed for days. Today, my mom told me to just talk to him and sort it since I'm still very heartbroken about it. That was a mistake.

He never did explain why he was truly angry, but he called me ungrateful and said I only see him as a wallet. My father is extremely important to me. He knows my insecurities about my health, and he's actively seen me miserable and crying from the pain and sickness. He adopted me when I was very small, paid for it himself. Im a daddys girl for sure. Hes kind of on a pedestal in my eyes. So, I was shocked. I seriously thought he understood, that I'd communicated well but he just wasn't even willing to talk or listen. I tried talking to mom next, to see if maybe it was just stress or something- but she said they both feel that way. And said when I see my pain doctor for the first time that he's going to say I don't have fibro and then we will have to start over. 

The medicine for fibro is the only thing I've taken that's eased any of my problems at all. My current doctors all agree on it. Hearing my support system doesn't believe it, doesn't believe ME? Is the most devastating thing I've ever heard. I'm angry, hurt, frustrated. I have my first psychiatrist appointment on Thursday, the place specializes in stress, but I dont know how to cope with yet another pain until then. My usual mechanisms don't work anymore. I've lost the feeling of joy I'd get from listening to music, writing, drawing, or anything else I do. There are days I sit in complete silence until my mom calls to tell me she got off work. I start things and can't finish them. And now, after hearing these things? I'm broken. I asked how they could say those things to me knowing I'm scared of hearing those exact words? ""You asked how we felt and we told you."" I feel like theyre right. Maybe I am ungrateful? I depend on them entirely, so what right do I have to be hurt by their frustration? But I'm the one that has to live this way? They get to go to work. They go out to eat. They have friends they can see, people they can talk to, things they enjoy. I've tried so hard not to be jealous of those freedoms, not to ask why they don't even consider asking me to join them for family activities outside Sunday dinner. It hurts hearing they've taken my brother out to spend time together, but won't visit me or offer to do anything else with me- even just sitting to watch something would make me happy. They've even stopped wanting to go to appointments with me, which is hard since I can't always drive. I'm having to burden my grandmother and my sister (best friend but shes practically family) for rides. 

I guess I just want some help to try and cope with these feelings? I called 988, which helped stop the anxiety attack/breakdown i was having, but I'm unable to sleep. I'm starting to hurt now and feel sick, so my body is flaring up from the stress. My heart physically hurts. I have to make it two more days until I can talk to anyone face to face and seek long-term help. 

How can I protect myself from my own negative thoughts when I feel so lost? I'm just so tired. Every fiber of my being wishes I could just sleep forever and not feel anything, but that's so opposite the kind of person I am. I have things I need to do still, and a pup that needs me, but I feel like everything is weighing me down and crushing me. Like I'm underwater and can't breathe. I miss my life. I miss my family. I miss hating my job some days, I miss my biggest struggle being how awkward I am, I miss my body, my confidence, my freedom. Everything.

I’m reaching out because I’m in a really tough place right now, and I don’t know where to turn. I’ve been feeling overwhelmed by my emotions and have this constant weight of guilt and shame, but I don’t even know what I’m guilty of. My mood swings are all over the place, and I can’t seem to find a balance. Sometimes, I feel so drained and hopeless, like there’s no point to anything. The thoughts of ending it all keep coming to my mind, but I’m scared to actually act on them. It feels like I’m trapped in this mental cycle that I can’t escape, even though I’m scared of what those thoughts mean.

I don’t have many people to talk to. I’ve distanced myself from everyone because I feel like no one can really understand what I’m going through. My family’s situation is strained, especially with my mom. Our relationship has been really hard lately, and it feels like there’s this constant tension between us. I’m often alone with these feelings, and it gets harder to keep pretending that I’m okay.

I don’t know what to do. It’s so hard to keep going when it feels like everything is falling apart, and I’m constantly fighting with myself. I’ve tried to cope by isolating myself and not dealing with the bigger issues, but I know that’s not healthy. I’m reaching out here because I’m desperate for some support. I need to know that I’m not alone in this and that someone can offer advice or just be there to listen. I’ve been through so much, and I’m struggling to see how I can make it through.

I feel like there’s no way out right now, but I want to hold onto the hope that things can get better.

1jje65l,2025-03-25T08:52:45,"Childhood trauma hitting hard rn
I’ve been severely depressed over the last couple of weeks and I’ve been trying to reopen the wounds of my childhood and one in particular is when I was in highschool in 10th grade. I don’t remember why I got in trouble but my mom punished me by locking me out of my bedroom, and not allowing me to shower nor change my clothes (including underwear). And I had to sleep on the couch without a blanket or pillow. I remember being a couple days into this punishment and I had sleeping pills that were prescribed to me by my psychiatrist. I remember getting up from the couch crying because I couldn’t understand why my mom would treat me like this. I went to the kitchen grabbed my sleeping pills and took all 27 pills. I wanted to die and I tried to kms. The next day I had school and I woke up super drowsy. I went to school and told my counselor what I did and immediately my mom was called and I had to be taken to the looney bin. 

Growing up I was always the one punished punished, even if it was something minor like not folding the laundry I would end up getting my phone taken away for months. If I didn’t say yes ma’am or no sir I would get a spankin. 

Was I just a horrible daughter. I don’t understand the punishments I would receive. I’m a mother now and I think about these things often and I would never treat my children the way she treated me. 

My brother also attempted suicide once I moved out. Literally my worst fear coming true. He put a belt around his neck and tightened is as much as he could, he blacked out and then heard voices screaming at him “wake up wake up!!! It’s not your time yet” he woke up. His hands were darker and it was hard for him to catch his breath. Our mom didn’t even notice he just tried to kill himself. My brother and I have both had close calls and these definitely weren’t our first attempts either. 

How can someone be so cruel to their kids that it makes them want to harm themselves. I’ll never understand. Our relationship with our mother is very rocky. At the moment I’m not speaking to her even tho she has tried to reach out. I just need space while I try to understand.

I think I’m severely depressed. It is getting to a point where I can’t take care of myself anymore. I’m a recovering addict and an alcoholic now, I’m trying to take advantage of the fact that I can’t afford alcohol anymore. 
I can’t just not afford alcohol. I can’t afford to eat, I can’t afford to do anything at all. Everything is going to bills. 
My food stamps are being stolen from me, which is a common issue right now where I live. 
Last week I showered twice. The second time was only because I couldn’t remember the last time I did shower. I had to get blackout drunk just to do my laundry. 
My body hurts all of the time, and right now I don’t have a bed so I’m sleeping on the floor which is contributing to it too. 
My job is starting to get under my skin with how demanding they’re becoming and how little theyre paying. They don’t care that I’m one of the highest performing employees. They only care about my attendance. I missed two days last week because I feel so awful and I’m worried I’ll lose my job this week. 
I don’t have any friends, and my family is all super busy but I also don’t blame them for not being able to see me much. My partner is in jail, and I feel like he’s falling out of love with me. I can’t even afford to be able to talk to him for the next couple weeks either. 
I haven’t ever had good luck with the healthcare system. It always has felt like I was a statistic and contributing to a paycheck. I know that isnt how it works but I’ve never really been treated like I mattered when it came to that shit. Not that I could afford it any way. 
Every day is getting harder to function. And if I stop being able to function I’ll be homeless again and lose everything I fought so hard to build up. 
I haven’t ever experienced something like this before. It feels like there’s a million pounds in my body. It feels like my limbs are full of concrete. I have so little motivation to shower or change my clothes, let alone go to work. I still go to work obviously, but it’s getting harder and harder every day to even roll over and check my phone. 
I don’t know what to do. If I try to reach out to anybody it’s just a “that sucks” type response. I have zero support, I have nothing that I care to work for.

1jjch26,2025-03-25T06:45:17,"I can't take it anymore
The past few months have been excruciatingly difficult. Mentally, I'm at a 2/10, and I contemplate no longer existing every hour. I'm fucked up, beyond any help probably, and can't even function these days. I only have myself to blame for that I guess. I have amazing people in my life, and despite their support and love, I just haven't been strong enough to overcome the trauma that plagues me. I really thought about ending it a few hours ago. Actively began sending the thank you's and goodbye text messages.. but as dumb as this may sound to some, I held on because I refuse to leave this Earth before my soul dog, a 16 year old angel who saved my life on multiple occasions, still looks for me when I'm not around. The thought of his sweet face, with eyes that are both nearly blind, but a nose that can sniff a treat from a mile away, looking for me but not ever finding me again just breaks me. Like of all things, that shatters my heart. I can't end things knowing he's held on for me for so long. 
I'm an extremely emotional person and cry often, even at the slightest thought of hurting or losing someone, but tonight I feel like I've been betrayed and disregarded again, by the person I love the most. Which has me stoic. Numb. Empty. I don't know if I'm crazy and am really the bad guy, but I've been trying so hard to be better and overcome my demons, he just never seems to see it. I know I burden everyone in my life, genuinely, I recognize how disgustingly difficult I can be to put up with. But am I really so bad that I warrant such cruel words? Maybe I am just dumb, but I don't feel like there is any amount of anger or frustration that warrants lashing out at your spouse so heartlessly.. There are ways in which one can express their feelings, while still respecting the emotions and mental health of their partner. I guess I'm just struggling because he said so many horrible things that only I have told myself, and despite feeling deserving of the painful truth, it is excruciatingly difficult to listen to someone you love me tell you the same things, not holding back their angry thoughts. The past few hours I've been alternating between sobbing uncontrollably and disassociating. The only other person in my life that I feel I can always call on, and never makes me feel like a burden, is my little brother. I tried calling him but hung up after a few rings. He's finishing his masters degree, and I'm so damn proud of him. He had to deal with me and my shit growing up but still has protected and cared for me without ever making me feel guilty. I don't want to bother him. In order to survive, I'm just going to drink my pain away, breaking almost three months of sobriety. I don't want to end it, but I don't want to be alive, yanno? So I'll do what I have to in order to cope.
I'm so sorry to anyone that took the time to read this, I guess I just needed to vent. I'm sorry if I seem pitiful or like I'm looking for sympathy, I promise I really am not trying to.

1jjcesm,2025-03-25T06:40:46,"22 year old, don’t know how to move forward in life.

Apparently I told my fling/gf? in LA that I was going to rape her when I was drunk over the phone after a mickey of vodka, four 473ml 5%’s and one 473ml 6.5%. This was extremely embarrassing to find out about, as I care about her very much. This is not the first time I have drunk-called her and said bad things to her, which I have no recollection of. My mother currently has Stage 3 lung cancer and is refusing treatment, no matter who talks to her, including my father and my two siblings (sisters) aged 37. I have a niece, and they’re planning a second baby, so Godspeed to her for that, though she has typical health issues like diabetes, etc. I hope she will be fine. They are currently in the process of getting her husband to receive Canadian sponsorship. Hopefully, he gets it; he already received a visa until 2030 since his wife and daughter are Canadian. I also have another sister who is 46, respectively (she has the first stages of cancer as well; my parents hide it because it’s something on the female side of things, if you get what I mean). My father is 63 and has early development of cognitive decline; the latest tests are signifying Alzheimer's or Lewy Body Dementia, unfortunately. Though in the clinic in Europe, they mentioned potential Parkinson’s, which is under doubt. My mother is 66 years old and has what I think is borderline personality disorder and severe anger outbursts towards me and our family members, or IED. We cannot get along, all of us. I do not know exactly what to call it or what it is. Anyway, I’m a 22-year-old male living with my father currently. My parents and I are pretty much separated, living together for six months or less here in Toronto; my mother escapes for six months on end to our country of origin. My mother and father are constantly fighting, both verbally and physically, and are in major conflict with me and each other. My mother is trying to hide her diagnosis and has banned me and my father from telling my sisters, so she has no clue we cracked to them, they tried leading her up to it but she doesn’t tell me the truth about her diagnosis or treatment, she is scared. I don’t know what to do or how to live and move forward; I’m suicidal. I don’t know how to escape this situation. I have mental issues. Phobias/Panic attacks from different scenarios mostly ones that have to do with large crowds and major social events, terrible depression etc. Depression is the main issue. I cannot function, I cannot lift up my face to look at my dad, these past 2-3 weeks it has been worse than usual. I sleep at 3-5am until later around in the day about 12-1pm, waking up throughout the night, I can’t fall asleep earlier, I’m having trouble functioning during the day. I’ve been having issues since 2020 when I was 17-18 years old. Have previous substance use. I can’t even talk to my father as he’s pretty dysfunctional, don’t leave my room unless I’m drinking with a friend/friends etc, I do not take medication, I just drink it away… I drink every other day 10+ drinks sometimes everyday, evenings though, I thug it out until 6-7pm. My mom says that I got carried away playing this “game” since I been 12 years old, showing weakness, that I’ve gone too far in my “game”, and now I’m paying the consequences, that I made it all up, whilst winding myself up. Please give me any advice that you have. I genuinely don’t know what to do anymore. This is not the full story just a brief summary. Whoever is out there, I greatly appreciate your help.

P.S. Apparently, my only outcome is the grave, as my mom says. She once told me if I killed myself, they would cry for a week and just leave the country.

1jjc2fu,2025-03-25T06:17:05,"Should I institutionalize myself?
First Reddit post, sorry for any formating issues. 

  
I, 25 F, have been dealing with depression for as long as I can remember. I was officially diagnosed at 15 and have been in therapy and on medication since. I've gotten to the point with my depression where treatment isn't working and I don't know what to do. 

  
To provide a little bit of context: I have been prescribed almost every anti-depressant you can think of, SSRI, SNRI, Mood Stabilizer, and Anti-Psychotic. I'm currently on 5 medications, a mixture of SSRIs, Mood Stabilizer,s and Anti-psychotics. I have officially been diagnosed with C-PTSD, Anxiety, Depression, Panic Disorder, BPD, ASD, and ADHD (I know, it's a lot). I have tried various types of therapy (CBT, DBT, psychotherapy, Individual Therapy). I see my therapist weekly and psychiatrist monthly. 

  
I am officially diagnosed with Severe Treatment Resistant Depression. Since I can remember, I have been wanting to die. I have never found joy in life and don't see much of a point in continuing it. I stay around because I know my friends and family would miss me but that doesn't seem like enough of a reason anymore. I'm tired of everything. I've tried to take my life 7 times at this point but it seems like some force out there is wanting me to stick around. To be honest, I'm scared of dying but that seems to be where all roads are leading. 

  
I recently started TMS for my depression and haven't noticed any differences. I'm still having extreme suicidal and self harm thoughts. I know that TMS takes a while to take effect but I'm at my whit's end. I don't think I am ready to leave yet but my brain is telling me otherwise. 

  
My question is, should I institutionalize myself? Would that help at all? I've been baker acted once before and that wasn't a pleasant experience so I'm honestly scared. But that seems to be my last option. Nothing else has worked. I'm tired of feeling like this and just want to be able to enjoy life.  I want to be able to smile with my friends and find happiness in the little things. 

  
My father was a bipolar addict and spent most of my life in and out of residential hospitals. It seemed to help him whenever he went. I wonder if they would be able to help me. Does anyone have experience with this? Any advice is appreciated.

1jjhncg,2025-03-25T12:59:43,"Difficult
Been depressed and considering suicide on and off for my entire adult life and my late teens. How severe it all was has varied significantly. Sometimes it's just a passive ""maybe I'll end it eventually"" or an ""I hope I don't wake up tomorrow."" Other times it's planning and thinking about how to do it, like now.

Went through a break-up a little over a year ago. Haven't recovered, really. It still hurts too much to live with. And I have nothing to live for anyway.

On top of that, been looking for someone new now for like a year and haven't found anyone. My social anxiety means I have no connections and I don't go anywhere and don't talk to anyone. Which means all I have is dating sites. I met two of my previous girlfriends on there but they've gotten a lot worse, imo, and I'm about to give up on at this point. I've just about had it with swiping and then talking to people, getting my hopes up, only for them to ghost me. Dozens of times over. I don't believe I can find anyone that way anymore.

I got desperate enough recently to even post an ""ad"" on Reddit seeing if I could find someone that way but, of course, no. I didn't expect to, it was just a move out of pure desperation.

I'm alone. I feel like I'll never find anyone again to be with as a partner. Hell, not even someone just to have sex with. I feel completely worthless. And I have nothing in my life. Nothing at all.

It would be a kindness to myself to end it and end it quickly. I know that. I'm just so freaking stubborn.

I need to end it though. I know that. And it's hanging over me a lot today. Have considered doing it right now, but I don't think I currently have what I need to do it in a ""good"" way.

I feel like I'm procrastinating on it though. And that always seems to happen. I procrastinate. I have to make the decision at some point. Maybe soon, it would be best.

I know it'll be better that way, but it's just so hard to do.

I wish either I actually had someone who loved me or a life with something in it worth staying for or at least an easier time ending it.

I know in the end posting this will do nothing. Few people will read it, few or no people will respond. Any that do respond will only be able to share that they feel the same way, or offer some vague words of encouragement. But nothing else. There's never anything else.

It was foolish to post this. But I don't know what else to do anymore. I'm desperate beyond desperate. Ending it is my only choice but it's just so freaking difficult.

1jjgxq5,2025-03-25T12:16:02,"I failed again
I (21,F) tried to kill myself last night by taking a whole pill box of antidepressants after a huge fight with my father. 
I had visited my parents after a long time. We always had problems as I struggled with my mental health since puberty but I felt better after years of therapy and medication. College years were also tough because I dealt with SA, depression, anxiety, EDs and severe PTSD. 

My whole life my father expressed how I was a burden to him (mentally, financially) and he was ashamed of my condition. I know that he loves me in his very own way but I don't think that he is a good parent just because he supported me financially. whenever he's stressed about something he takes it out on us and it's affected me since I was little. 
Yesterday we had a big fight about me finishing my studies (4 years) a semester late because I was working at the same time so attending classes was difficult for me. However, I have only 10 courses left to graduate. But he told me that I don't deserve his support and he will no longer do that for me. 

He spoke to me so badly that I couldn't handle it. After a lot of crying and shouting, I went to my room and thought that I couldn't stand being a burden to anyone anymore. I texted my boyfriend who lives in another city that I loved him and that I wanted him to take care of my dog ​​and while I was taking the pills I turned off my phone. This is the 4th time I've tried to end my life so I packed my things in a suitcase so they wouldn't have to clean them up later and locked the door until the time was up and I died. 

My boyfriend probably called my mom and told her because after 20 minutes she started knocking on my door. I don't even remember how I opened it for her but I remember feeling like I was in a dream. He found the empty box and made me throw up in the bathroom until my stomach was empty. 

My younger brother and father didn't understand anything. She gave me a lot of fluids with the threat that otherwise she would take me to the hospital. I had some symptoms like I was drunk and I was definitely a little scared because I felt like my heart was going to break. I fell asleep and woke up late today. 

Is it normal to be angry with my mom for not letting me die? Also, is it reasonable that I don't want to go to a psychiatric clinic?

  For I recall being suicidal and in sorrow many times before.  Things slowly changed.  Things improved.
 I felt relieved having persevered the dark times. Once I healed, thoughts of killing myself seem absolutely absurd.  What was I thinking?  Yet, here I am again.  Tormented by thoughts of taking my life.  
   So friends, take heart.  I know you are suffering but remember the times when you recovered.  Remember how you overcame and felt good again.  How feeling suicidal was something you would never do.  
    This is not your first rodeo.   Yes, I want to give up ""now"".  Yes, each day is long and exhausting. Be strong and don't give up despite what those wicked thoughts in you mind are telling you.  You have value and are loved.  You will get through this.  There are millions of people suffering like you all over the world at this very moment. You are not alone!
    It's not easy I know.  You don't want to hear this. 
Yet, you can experience happiness again.  You will have more bad times too. Life is a struggle. The good times and bad. Joy and despair. Our life is like the weather.   The dark cloud come but the Sun does return.  I pray you will fight on.

1jje6kz,2025-03-25T08:53:42,"i (ftm21) want to die, no shock. haha.


tl;dr. parents neglected me. daddy issues. mommy does drugs. granny is an amputee. grandpa has some type of memory disorder. i feel worthless, guilt ridden, pathetic. 


as the title states. i don’t even really know how to start this. i was born premature. 3 months. i had to be on medicine and oxygen for the first few months of my life. i grew up as the youngest of a brother and two sisters. my mother was a drug addicted (xanax and pain pills. probably more, i’m dumb and naive) and my father was emotionally absent, and always enabling my mother. i was taken away away a child and given to my step-grandma and my grandpa, i lived with them happily for a little more than a year before being given back. whenever covid kid in 2020, i have lived here ever since. 
when i lived at my grandparents as a kid, i was a happy kid. i had friends. i guess i was also 7 so that helps too. but once i was given back I was neglected. hard. i forgot about my homework, my hygiene. i moved schools and none of the kids really liked me because i was “weird”. i didn’t have any friends. i escaped to the internet and i would talk to older men. I was a god awful child. I acted out, i was a pathological liar, i wanted attention any way i could. it was awful. when i was 15-17 i met a man on grindr. he was 26-30. i lied to him. i told him i was of age and we had sex. he learned a week or two after that i was in fact a child, but he didn’t want to stop. so we contuined.
this relationship still hasn’t ended. i am still in contact with him to this day. we just officially broke up a month ago. but i’m such a people pleaser i can’t help but go over there and please him. i cannot hurt his feelings. the guilt kills me.
fuck the guilt. it’s the main reason I think i want to end it all. i have so much guilt about everything in my life. i cannot disappoint anyone. everyone must like me and i must make everyone happy, if I don’t then… then they’ll hate me. I hate telling people no, or literally just needing to leave someone’s house or lunch or whatever it may be. i also have some weird kinks, i’m not dealing with those here. I also have some weird survivors guilt about living through my birth (??) it sounds fucking ridiculous. i feel like i’ve done nothing in the past 6 years. I’ve started smoking weed around 15, i still do. i do nothing on my days off besides get off, watch youtube, and cry. i’m a worthless loser. I barely graduated high school. I’ve tried to go to college, I went two semesters and just disappointed myself. I don’t believe I add anything meaningful to the world. I have a few “friends” who I speak to weekly. i don’t think my death would really impact them though. i don’t want it to. i want to just die and have everyone forget that i ever even existed. that’s the way it should’ve been 21 fucking years ago.
i also have somehow convinced myself that maybe if i did die as a newborn that maybe my mom would’ve not have been such a stupid bitch. she would’ve gotten clean, stopped abusing her other children. she could’ve been an actual good mother. that’s just wishful thinking though. a month or two ago she told me that I was a “waste of human life” and that she was going to get her name removed from my birth certificate. it’s crazy, hearing your own mother say that to you, after 21 years of telling you up and down how much of a miracle you were and how much of a gift you were.
i don’t think about my parents much really, i don’t think they’re really the reason for me wanting to kill myself. they haven’t helped though. i know that their neglect has fucked me up in so many ways. again, why did I get to live? is it just some sick fucking cruel joke? 
i’ve had many near death experiences i think. my sister always tells me a story about how since my mom was a nurse, she got to take me home early from the nicu. one day, presumably after popping a few pills, she laid down with me in her arms after she turned the alarms off of all of my machines (yk, the ones keeping me alive?). she fell asleep and my sister had to wake her up. my oxygen mask had fallen off. i’ve gotten deathly ill with the flu when I was both 5 and 9. I flipped my car when I was 16. I remember being so close to the concert… if i was just going a bit faster then I would’ve hit my head and probably died on impact. fuck. it’s like a dream. i always think about those times. and I ask myself; has my life gotten any better? and the answer is always, no. it hasn’t. 
let’s circle back to the man from grindr. M. M took my virginity. he was my very first everything. I devoted everything to him, he was my first love and best friend. but as i literally grew up, i kinda realized how bad it was for both of us. how wrong it was. i feel guilty for it taking so long for it to hit me. he doesn’t understand, he cannot wrap his head around it, and he’s so fucking depressed sbout it and it’s also making me depressed. i don’t want to hurt him. I love him and want to make this as easy as possible, but i’ve never done anything like this before.
i dunno. i’ve felt this way since i was 9. i’ve always wanted to leave. my first attempt was at 9 i believe, the second at 12, the third time and first time i got hospitalized was at 14. i haven’t been back since and haven’t tried since then. I started to cut myself whenever i was 17. I’m just so tired.
I know people rely on me, mostly my grandparents. i’ve been trying to hold off for them. it’s hard though. i feel selfish thinking about it, and wanting it so bad. once again, i wish i died as a newborn. i wouldn’t of had to grow up and be here, an actual conscious person. i hate it all. i fucking hate it. and this? this is the peak of pitifulness, crying to a bunch of strangers on the internet. jesus fuck. i’m tired and going to bed, i’ll probably be here tomorrow.",ftm21 want die shock haha tldr parents neglected daddy issues mommy drugs granny amputee grandpa type memory disorder feel worthless guilt ridden pathetic title states dont even really know start born premature 3 months medicine oxygen first months life grew youngest brother two sisters mother drug addicted xanax pain pills probably im dumb naive father emotionally absent always enabling mother taken away away child given stepgrandma grandpa lived happily little year given back whenever covid kid 2020 lived ever since lived grandparents kid happy kid friends guess also 7 helps given back neglected hard forgot homework hygiene moved schools none kids really liked weird didnt friends escaped internet would talk older men god awful child acted pathological liar wanted attention way could awful 1517 met man grindr 2630 lied told age sex learned week two fact child didnt want stop contuined relationship still hasnt ended still contact day officially broke month ago im people pleaser cant help go please cannot hurt feelings guilt kills fuck guilt main reason think want end much guilt everything life cannot disappoint anyone everyone must like must make everyone happy dont theyll hate hate telling people literally needing leave someones house lunch whatever may also weird kinks im dealing also weird survivors guilt living birth sounds fucking ridiculous feel like ive done nothing past 6 years ive started smoking weed around 15 still nothing days besides get watch youtube cry im worthless loser barely graduated high school ive tried go college went two semesters disappointed dont believe add anything meaningful world friends speak weekly dont think death would really impact though dont want want die everyone forget ever even existed thats way shouldve 21 fucking years ago also somehow convinced maybe die newborn maybe mom wouldve stupid bitch wouldve gotten clean stopped abusing children couldve actual good mother thats wishful thinking though month two ago told waste human life going get name removed birth certificate crazy hearing mother say 21 years telling much miracle much gift dont think parents much really dont think theyre really reason wanting kill havent helped though know neglect fucked many ways get live sick fucking cruel joke ive many near death experiences think sister always tells story since mom nurse got take home early nicu one day presumably popping pills laid arms turned alarms machines yk ones keeping alive fell asleep sister wake oxygen mask fallen ive gotten deathly ill flu 5 9 flipped car 16 remember close concert going bit faster wouldve hit head probably died impact fuck like dream always think times ask life gotten better answer always hasnt lets circle back man grindr took virginity first everything devoted everything first love best friend literally grew kinda realized bad us wrong feel guilty taking long hit doesnt understand cannot wrap head around hes fucking depressed sbout also making depressed dont want hurt love want make easy possible ive never done anything like dunno ive felt way since 9 ive always wanted leave first attempt 9 believe second 12 third time first time got hospitalized 14 havent back since havent tried since started cut whenever 17 im tired know people rely mostly grandparents ive trying hold hard though feel selfish thinking wanting bad wish died newborn wouldnt grow actual conscious person hate fucking hate peak pitifulness crying bunch strangers internet jesus fuck im tired going bed ill probably tomorrow,4,1,0,Negative,High

And I don’t really know how to go forward from this… I had planned it all, more extensively than I ever did before. 

Broke up with my gf before because I thought that would make it easier on her if we were not to be together at the end… I packed my stuff into one backpack and headed out. I fought with her brother and dad on the street on the sidewalk. Because they thought I just walked out on us after 3 years with no notice.

Even someone driving past noticed and asked if we were okay. I yelled at him.

I stormed off and later she said she would drop me off at the train station at least. We talked and she did. We cried. I said goodbye. She didn’t trust it and tracked my location. I left the station to go to the woods. Headphones in, smoking cigarettes after being sober for 2,5 years. 

She got scared and kept talking to me through texts and I wanted to find a peaceful spot to sit down and listen to music and prepare myself. Got to a bench, drenched in sweat, smoking and sat down, crying. Sobbing just feeling awful. My gf tried calling me time after time, eventually I picked up because I didn’t want to brush her off either. She tried hard to comfort me and tell me she loved me and that I should come back home. We talked for about an hour while I felt the most sad, most miserable, lonesome feeling you could imagine.

Eventually I let her and she picked me up to go back home and talk some things over. 

Now it’s a couple days later and I scared her whole family. Had to make a crisis backup plan. Including her and my therapist. Talk about how I really feel.

I've strugged with suicidal thoughts since I was 11 and it has been getting worse since I transitioned (MtF). Everyone says I pass really well, but it doesn't matter. Everytime I look in the mirror I see a distorted version of who I want to be. I don't see a point in contributing to society if I'm not good enough to be wanted. I plan on trying to do the things I've wanted to do before I eventually end it all, like try out certain things or buy things I've always wanted to own for myself. I'd probably end it in July. I want to make it to my 21st birthday first for... reasons you can guess. I mean, I tried alcohol before, it's just that I want to try other alcoholic beverages like wine, hard lemonade, or even sake.

""If a woman ever calls you cute , she's either a bot or a scammer cuz you're definitely NOT cute""

Just got out of an severely abusive relationship with a woman I thought had genuine feelings for me.

She never liked me , nobody does. She made me feel even uglier that I already am. Even made a backhanded post about me to further break me and then laughed after she did it. I'm too ugly and my friend was right. If any woman shows interest she definitely has a ulterior motive because I look horrible. It sucks that I had to learn that the hard way.

1jjcyyz,2025-03-25T07:20:58,"Suicide is the only way out for me
Backstory: I'm 21. I'm an immigrant from Russia, living in Finland. Everything was relatively normal. BUT I'M A FUCKING TRANSGENDER (woman). About a year ago I asked for help because it became impossible. Doctors openly laughed at me and at most prescribed anti-depressants that didn't help. I was completely suicidal, and in Finland it's impossible to get hormones unless you're 100% mentally healthy (and it takes 5 years anyway). So I decided to buy hormones unofficially. I felt better. 

But then my parents found hormones. They said they were disappointed because my penis was no longer erect. They used to look at my penis with pleasure, but now my mother cries because she no longer sees my working penis in the morning. They threatened me with renunciation, violence, murder if I continued taking hormones. My parents forbade me to talk to friends and communicate on the Internet, forbade me to shave my body hair, forbade me to take hormones, forbade me to have long hair, forced me to call them every hour and a half so that they would know where I was.

I couldn't live like that, my mother went back to Russia, but my parents continued to demand that I call and confirm that I don't communicate with anyone and don't touch my body hair and eyebrows. It was unbearable. One day, my father was talking on the phone about how great Elon Musk and Trump are and how rightly they want to exterminate all the transgender scum. He was so pleased with himself, I yelled at him. After that, my parents started to treat me even worse, they constantly called and wrote to me that I was an ungrateful scum who didn't respect my parents. That I was a disgrace to the family.

I contacted social services and moved to a safe house out of fear. But one day my mother wrote to me that she was in Finland. She demanded her things from her old apartment, otherwise she would go to the police and have me arrested as a thief. I had to give her the things. We agreed that I would put the things on the street.

I went into the apartment (which I hadn’t been in for a long time), took the things, opened the door, and my father was standing behind the door. I was shocked, I thought that my father didn’t have a visa, I tried to close the door, but he wouldn’t let me. He grabbed me by the neck and hair and pressed me to the floor. I don’t remember what he said. I think he demanded repentance and apologies, and to stop the hormones. I tried to break free, but he held me tightly with my face on the floor, during which I injured my arm, and I have bruises on one leg. 

I managed to get out, but my father took my backpack (there were documents in the backpack) and my phone. He held on to the backpack until the very end and I had to let go.

My mother was waiting for me on the street, I was shocked that she had lied and set up such a trap. I yelled at her, explained the situation at the nearest store and they called the police. The police arrived, they returned the keys to the apartment (which my father demanded to give me, but I refused, so he took them by force). But they did not find the phone (I forgot about the documents then).

Later I managed to find my things with a little help from the police, but it doesn't matter.

I am currently living in a safe house, I have no money because I am an immigrant so I am not eligible for benefits, I can't find a job, the hospital refused to help me because I have a history of violence and dissociative symptoms (the doctor said it was because I was uncomfortable looking in the mirror after puberty). Because of this, I can't get treatment for gender dysphoria. I have to self-medicate. I have been on hormones for 5 months now, at first everything was fine and my self-harm and panic attacks stopped. After the incident with my parents, the panic attacks came back and every day I just sit and cry for a couple of hours. It is very difficult for me to do anything.

As an immigrant, I need to have money to live in Finland, which I don't have. I have no money to pay for my student fees for next year. I will most likely be deported to Russia, where I will either be killed or forced to attend conversion therapy by my parents (my parents have already forced me to attend a conversion therapist via video link). 

To sum up: I have no job, no money, I can't get official treatment for my injury, I have no friends or relatives, and I'm facing deportation to Russia.

Social workers said it wasn't that bad. That I could live like the real me at least. But that's a lie. I can't. I look like a disgusting man. Hormones haven't done anything, I don't even have money for food. How can I live like the real me? How can I live at all?

That's why I have no choice but to kill myself. I can't wait until I die of hunger or get deported to Russia. I decided to leave on my own terms.

I work 20 km from my workplace (which means an hour's drive there and an hour's drive back in traffic), to earn 1340 euros a month (I work about 40 hours a week), but all this pace is making me seriously stressed (I have a difficult job, I'm an educator who works in a nursing home with the elderly and managing families, colleagues, long working hours is not easy) unfortunately here at home I always have little time, because I'm tired to carry on friendships, hobbies or anything else.

I had risked life twice when i was driving at home from work. The first time I found myself on a level crossing in the dark, without even seeing a traffic light and the barriers were coming down. A second time I entered a road the wrong way without realizing that that was the wrong road.

I play the guitar, I go out every now and then, I love listening to music and reading and doing graphics. I'm seriously thinking about going back home to my family and starting over. It's really hard to put money away, everything here costs double and I'm always anxious that something won't break.

1idbugy,2025-01-30T03:26:54,"slowly realizing i am not as okay as i thought
I am a 23-year-old woman about to graduate college, and to put it plainly, I’ve lived a relatively normal, stereotypical life for an American female—middle-class family, small town, graduated high school at the top of my class, went to college nearby, and now I’m preparing to move six hours away to start my dream job. I’ve been incredibly fortunate to have two married parents, a stable home, and food on the table. My childhood was, for the most part, uneventful, with the exception of my dad’s temper issues, which were rough until he was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in my high school years. Once he started treatment, things got better, and overall, I can’t say I had a difficult upbringing.

I’ve spent my entire life trying to be the kid my parents never had to worry about. I got good grades, made friends, participated in sports, and never caused trouble. I’ve always been extremely independent, which in many ways has served me well, but it has also left me with the habit of handling everything alone, even when I probably shouldn’t.

When it comes to relationships, I dated my high school boyfriend for five years before realizing he had fallen in love with my friend. I broke up with him, and while I was never angry at him, it took me a long time to stop blaming myself. He and my friend are getting married next year, and I hold no resentment toward them—I’ve accepted that we weren’t right for each other. But for a long time, I genuinely believed it was my fault that he stopped loving me, and that mindset sent me into a spiral that took years to untangle.

My next relationship was with a guy I met on a dating app. Partway through, he got his ex pregnant. He swore the baby wasn’t his, and we went through the entire paternity test ordeal before learning he had been lying about the timeline of their relationship. 

After that, I started dating someone I met while working as a counselor at a summer camp, but about a year in, I found out he was sleeping with his roommate. He broke up with me to be with her.

Most recently, I was with a military guy who had serious alcohol and drug issues. There’s too much to say about that situation, but it ended in a spectacularly messy way. Instead of just admitting he wasn’t relationship material, he created elaborate lies and tried to make me look insane to everyone in my small town. Fortunately, people who know me saw through it, and my dad even confronted him at a bar and got back some money he owed me from a trip we took together. This all happened last month, and I’m still struggling with the aftermath. Even though I’ve been reassured I didn’t do anything wrong, I keep questioning myself, wondering if I could have done something differently. I’ve been reading about the paranoia that comes with substance abuse, trying to understand why he acted the way he did, but it hasn’t made me feel any better.

The real reason I’m writing this is because, for the first time, I’m realizing I am not as emotionally stable as I thought I was. I’ve always considered myself strong and put-together, but now, I feel like I don’t trust myself. I constantly assume that everything is my fault. My least favorite icebreaker question is, “Tell me three things you love about yourself,” because I can never think of anything. I hate talking about myself. I am about to graduate with two degrees, and yet, I almost settled for an alcoholic with a drug problem because I thought it was the best I could do.

I take care of myself physically—I work out, eat well, and put effort into my appearance—yet I don’t like the way I look. I know I’m not objectively unattractive, but I still struggle to see myself as good enough. When people compliment me, I assume they’re just trying to be nice. My mom recently got mad at me when she found out I had made the Dean’s List every semester for five years and never once mentioned it to her. It never occurred to me to tell her because I didn’t think it was a big deal. In my mind, being on the Dean’s List wasn’t an accomplishment—it was an obligation that came with going to college.

My friends have pointed out that I am way more compassionate toward them than I am toward myself. They tell me I need to stop being so hard on myself, but I don’t know how. I can’t seem to step outside my own head long enough to see myself the way they see me. No matter how much I achieve, I always feel like I am not enough. Worse, I feel like the people around me secretly think I’m annoying, embarrassing, or failing in some way.

Anyway, I don't want to be dramatic and say I hate myself or whatever, but I am finding it so difficult to see that I am worthy of being happy, or that I am all the good things I hear about myself. Therapy is not an option for me right now, so I guess I am asking if you have similar issues, how you tackle the self care aspect of your life and how you get yourself out of these holes.",slowly realizing okay thought 23yearold woman graduate college put plainly ive lived relatively normal stereotypical life american femalemiddleclass family small town graduated high school top class went college nearby im preparing move six hours away start dream job ive incredibly fortunate two married parents stable home food table childhood part uneventful exception dads temper issues rough diagnosed depression anxiety high school years started treatment things got better overall cant say difficult upbringing ive spent entire life trying kid parents never worry got good grades made friends participated sports never caused trouble ive always extremely independent many ways served well also left habit handling everything alone even probably shouldnt comes relationships dated high school boyfriend five years realizing fallen love friend broke never angry took long time stop blaming friend getting married next year hold resentment toward themive accepted werent right long time genuinely believed fault stopped loving mindset sent spiral took years untangle next relationship guy met dating app partway got ex pregnant swore baby wasnt went entire paternity test ordeal learning lying timeline relationship started dating someone met working counselor summer camp year found sleeping roommate broke recently military guy serious alcohol drug issues theres much say situation ended spectacularly messy way instead admitting wasnt relationship material created elaborate lies tried make look insane everyone small town fortunately people know saw dad even confronted bar got back money owed trip took together happened last month im still struggling aftermath even though ive reassured didnt anything wrong keep questioning wondering could done something differently ive reading paranoia comes substance abuse trying understand acted way hasnt made feel better real reason im writing first time im realizing emotionally stable thought ive always considered strong puttogether feel like dont trust constantly assume everything fault least favorite icebreaker question tell three things love never think anything hate talking graduate two degrees yet almost settled alcoholic drug problem thought best could take care physicallyi work eat well put effort appearanceyet dont like way look know im objectively unattractive still struggle see good enough people compliment assume theyre trying nice mom recently got mad found made deans list every semester five years never mentioned never occurred tell didnt think big deal mind deans list wasnt accomplishmentit obligation came going college friends pointed way compassionate toward toward tell need stop hard dont know cant seem step outside head long enough see way see matter much achieve always feel like enough worse feel like people around secretly think im annoying embarrassing failing way anyway dont want dramatic say hate whatever finding difficult see worthy happy good things hear therapy option right guess asking similar issues tackle self care aspect life get holes,2,9,0,Neutral,Low
1ic2ozj,2025-01-28T15:25:29,"Searching for someone who understands :(
I have OCD and no therapist until, at least, Easter. I was struggling quite badly again yesterday and ended up having a breakdown throwing stuff at the wall, even though I desperately want to fix things. My mother walked in and finally drove me to the train station where I begged my boyfriend to stay for the night. My relationship with my mother is really bad, which I feel guilty for, and I am sure she will be sad for the whole week now. I live alone with her, and I get extremely anxious and stressed when she even enters the house. I hurt her emotionally even though I don‘t want to. My boyfriend is the only person who genuinely understands and cares. So many people think I‘m doing fine, even when I tell them I am not, and so many people tell me what to do better, even though I already feel so terribly guilty about every little thing I fail at. My boyfriend doens‘t, but he has his own life, and I want to stop crying, screaming and insulting him when it gets bad.I want him to be able to leave me for a few days without a drama.

I’m 17 years old, writing this in January 2025.

I do believe I have autism, and so my two pedestrians. I haven’t been properly diagnosed because it cost a lot of money and/or takes years to get tested, I’ve been on waiting lists for a long time. Also I might have ptsd because  my childhood was very very physiologically traumatic. I don’t think I should go into detail because of the sever rules. I have/had anxiety, depression and just all of those things that are kinda common.

I feel like my thoughts are constantly speeding 24/7, and I have crippling insomnia. I very often think intensely deep while dissociating. In the past year, I get the feeling where I know too much or I just understand too easily. Except it wasn’t about school, it was about this thing that I can’t explain at all. I call it “idk”. “idk” is like infinitely impossible to explain. 

I feel like I’m on a different frequency than everyone and that I see reality in ways I could never explain. It’s like most human’s brains were coded to process information in a common pattern. But my brain doesn’t follow that pattern. instead of doing up down left and right, my brain goes somewhere else. It’s like everyone’s brain follows a track that turns to the right, but mine turns to the left. I physically cannot turn right because my track goes the left. And others can’t turn left because their track goes to the right.


I feel like careers jobs education money and just all those human things are just not it. To me it seems like lost opportunity, and ineffective. I don’t seek to fit in with others or need validation. 

I’m the past months and especially recently, I’ve been feeling hopeless, stuck, yk all the things you can think of. But I also feel like I’m dying, and I feel ok with it. I feel like that’s the most agreeable, thumbs up, ok, understandable thing that has ever been in my brain. It isn’t the answer to my questions, and I don’t want to die, I’m just very ok with it. it’s this thing that is perfect and beautifully neutral in all imaginal ways possible.  I feel like I’ve just been coming to conclusions in my head, I can’t describe it but all I can say is just, I get it.


I could keep talking about my thoughts and feelings but I want to wrap this up now. Please just give me anything you can, maybe all I need is to hear some random thing from someone else. Just give me what you got. I guess the big concern here is my current state and I don’t think I can help myself anymore. I have lived my life helping myself to push myself, but this work is getting way too heavy and I need help. I have done a lot, there are people that are very informed on me and try to help me, but I think I may never find help. 

If you have any questions I will answer them. Like if you need more info about a specific thing I said, I will have more things to say about it.

1i5sv33,2025-01-20T16:35:38,"My mental health is dwindling and I don’t know what to do
  This lengthy post pertains to my 43 year old wife and 18 year old step daughter. I’m a 35 year old male and I feel like my mental health is almost non existent after being in this relationship for 8 years. I could go on for days with numerous stories. But for the sake of time I’ll do a quick recap of a few instances to see if I’m crazy or if I can find some sort solace.

  Some background is that my SD has autism. The therapist has said that she is very well adjusted and is capable living a good life and is capable of living on her own. My wife has bipolar, PTSD, anxiety, and schizophrenia. Due to a very traumatic childhood. I have ADHD and possibly some sort anxiety due to events that have occurred throughout this relationship.

  What I fear is that due to my wife’s upbringing is that she would rather play the role of best friend than the role of parent to avoid any kind of conflict with her daughter. When any sort of parenting needs to be done her daughter will be stand offish and twist words to such an extent that her mom almost completely checks out. Just to note we dont yell or curse at her. We sit down and try to explain how her actions hurt her and can hurt others. She somehow always blame others or us. The bio dad never has held her accountable and some times agree with that it is other people just wanting to be mean to her. One time she got a email from her art teacher that her assignment was not within guidelines and need to be redone. The bio dad’s response was “well all art teachers are d*cks”.

  In recent events, SD was not doing her school work in a timely manner when at her dad’s house. My wife tried suggesting that she get started so she could she could get her full hours in. Almost automatically she starts saying that she doesn’t want too and will do it later. The wife then explains she will only have like two hours of work done instead of the standard five. The SD then starts getting disrespectful with her and starts outright refusing. She gets off the phone and messages back two hours later saying that she is done with her work.  So that shows she did not do what was expected in the standard school day. We have gotten numerous emails from teachers that she has not turned in work or is doing it so fast that it is resulting in bad grades. The worst is when we was informed that she didn’t turn in a whole month of work. When asked she said that the teacher said that since she has a ISP that she didn’t have to do it. The teacher said that was not the case. when in a doctor’s sessions SD admitted that she just didn’t want to do the work. When asked by us again she tried to back track and lie to us again about the situation.

 So when we finally got the SD back this weekend. My wife brought up how she felt disrespected and was only trying to help her down the right path. SD then starts to say that she was disrespected and intimidated. When nobody was yelling or threatening any sort of punishment. The next day she proceeds to tell her mom “ I’m just a disappointment and I feel like you guys are going to withhold food”.  Not once was any of that said. We don’t believe in doing that to any person. Especially since my wife was denied food and many other cruel punishments as a child. I finally had enough and told my SD what she said was ridiculous that we would never do such a thing and she knows that. My wife then tells her daughter the story about how she was denied food and would never do that to any body. The wife told her that comment about withholding food really hurt her feelings. SD that says “ well my feelings was hurt”. 

  I just feel like I’m going crazy. Every time something occurs SD goes into a frenzy that makes her mom and me so anxious. Most of the time the wife and I argue because she would rather leave it be then deal with the fallout of holding her daughter accountable. The wife says that she don’t want to loose her daughter by making do what is expected of her at this age. I tell her that if her daughter doesn’t shape up that she’s not going to be live the life that she wants. That we will have to live in this near constant anxious state the rest of our lives because the SD will most likely still will be living at home because she lives in this fantasy land that she doesn’t do anything wrong. 

 Two last things to say that shows how I feel like my mental health is at a major decline.

1) I had to go see a heart specialist due to how anxious or upset I get due to the stress of everything.

2) SD doesn’t like needles. So one time when she was getting a blood draw. She went into such a frenzy that a nurse thought she was getting beat at home. The hospital got CPS involved and sent someone out. The CPS worker concluded that there was no abuse and the SD was just being disruptive. I think that’s when I started to get these anxiety attacks because I was working at an elementary school that I rathered enjoy and felt like a visit from CPS would jeopardize my livelihood/safety.

So please if there is any advice that can be given or if anyone that has been in a similar situation. Please post any ideas or stories it would be very much appreciated.

1i1apr0,2025-01-14T18:01:34,"strange place - short piece on mental illness
My head is the strange place. It’s the cliché answer, the one no one wants to hear, but it’s the truth. I am the strange place. My brain gets stuck on random thoughts and won’t let them go, no matter what I do. I get caught in their cycle and start to lose faith in anything. Feeling like I can’t do anything, I’m speaking from a deep, dark hole of nothingness into which I stumbled.

My brain doesn’t work like other people’s. I misinterpret almost everything with a negative slant. I can’t trust my head. It leads me astray and badgers me incessantly. My head led me into a partial hospitalization program and away from my friends. It sends me into a panic at things other people wouldn’t even notice. Like some evolutionary quirk, my head has lost its self-preservation instincts and is trying to destroy me from within. I have to fight against it to see any semblance of joy.

I can’t blame anyone else: it’s me. It’s my chemistry, my neural pathways. And so, I dedicate all of my work and energy into fighting what I can’t be rid of: my own mind. I’m determined to find a way to wrangle it under my control and coax it into repose.

What would it be like to have a normal mind—one that wants me to succeed, not crumble and wither under a rock? I catch glimpses of a healthier mind when I take an anti-anxiety medication: what it feels like to be normal. It wears off in about three hours, and then the dread sets in, but at least I get a glimpse. A glimpse into the ease of existence.

1hw8ku5,2025-01-08T03:01:27,"LONG story, just putting this out there to see if anyone can relate and let me know I'm not alone
In Elementary through early high school I was bullied. I was always the tiny quiet white kid so I was a target for bullying that wasn't exactly severe but it was continuous for most of my life. I think this has been the root of much of my issues. 

One I got into high school I always had a deep need for connection and yearning. After COVID we came back and I got into a big friend group. I didn't realize how bad of an influence many of those kids were at the time because I was still a dumb teen like we all were, but I expectedly got into trouble due to hanging out with them. 

I started skipping classes, got into fights, got obsessed with following drama. I never had friends like that, that at the time seemed great because they were the only people in my life to give me lots of ""respect"" and affection.

I hungout with the group before and sometimes after school, at the parking lot across the street. It was a big group, probably the biggest group of the school. If you were in it, you knew almost everyone and almost everyone knew you. Until I met them, I never had any meaningful connections with people. I never had a girlfriend until then, only had a few friends every grade at the most.



I have had a severe feeling of loneliness for years. This resulted in a lot of embarrassing moments. For one example; a girl in the group that I was friends with, who I'll call A. I had a crush on A and developed an obsessive relationship that makes me cringe so much when I look back on it. 

Whenever she wouldn't answer my texts immediately, I would fly into a silent rage and yelled at her one time through text. This whole thing caused some of the group to be divided over my reactions to everything, some thought (knew) I overreacted to put it lightly. Some got her to apologize to me which was bs.

When A started dating one of my friends, I got jealous. I wanted to be with her so bad that I got nightmares of her having sex with him, and was always scared that they would end up doing it. When I eventually found out they did, my heart was pounding and I got depressed over it. 

Eventually I got over it and didn't care anymore once the relationship wasn't relevant to me and there was never a chance. Also she cheated on her boyfriend so I dodged a bullet there. Though I guess she also dodged me, to be fair. 

I think this whole obsession towards being with someone and whatnot, started in 8th grade. There was this one girl who had a crush on me so hard that she basically sexually harassed me the whole year. I won't go into detail here, the stories with her are kind of funny thinking about it, but if the roles were reversed I'd be getting a teacher's meeting lol.

At first I didn't like her but after while I developed a crush, obsessing and fantasizing over her. Never got with her obviously, but all of that must have awakened something in me because I never even cared about relationships or sex until that point.



In Junior year of HS, there was another girl in the group. She was a crazy goth chick, who I'll call Z. She hated men and wanted them to go extinct, yet she got ran through by half the guys in the school. She started drama and fights with all of her exes and claimed all of her 300 exes were abusive or rapists. To be fair to myself, most of this info I didn't know until long after I broke up with her, but the red flags were still bright and waving in the sky. I was so desperate for love that I accepted when she asked me out.

Z was my first girlfriend and sadly my first kiss. I was so unused to affection that whenever any girl would hug me I would freeze and my mind would short-circuit. She found out about my lack of affection so she put up some type of act about caring about me, she made it her job to always give me affection (hugs, forehead kisses). Looking back I know she just did all that to make her last ex (who I was friends with at the time) jealous. But then that all got me hooked onto not just her but that friend group.

It didn't take long for drama to start. Basically, one of her exes apparently raped her once and after they broke up he kept following her around like a lost puppy, also his sister was talking about killing everyone in the group. This was all her words because she was yapping to the group about this. So what decision do I automatically take? I want to fight the guy 🤣. At this time I wasn't dating Z or even liked her, we were just acquaintances. I knew the fight was a stupid decision, and I kept debating with myself if I should be doing that or not, kept thinking on how to get away with it.

Some force kept making me ignore the rational thinking. Looking back, it was clearly because due to my past of being bullied, my life was riddled with experiences of being put down and made to feel weak. That fight was my chance to finally earn respect and feel tough like everyone else. So I went for it. Me and some of the group waited to catch him outside one day, and one day we finally did, but I hesitated and he ran away. I spent that whole week building up a false confidence to fight him. Then, one other day, we finally caught him off guard at a location across the street.

He was sitting at a bench and I went over and punched him and the fight started. It was a pretty boring fight, I threw haymakers every once in awhile and chased him as he tried to run away. I never even noticed because the memory is so blurry but he was actually throwing punches, I couldn't tell because the dude was comically weak but he was actually hitting me with his phone. He was one of the football players at the school so he finally hit me with a little tackle and we fell to the ground. 

For some reason even though he had me on the ground, he just sat there and let me punch his face in from the ground. Two girls came over, held him up and positioned him for me to punch him again. Jumping is pussy as hell but I was blinded by anger so I hit him one more time. I walked over to the group and noticed some looking at me in horror as I felt something cold on my forehead. 

Since he used his phone as a weapon on me, I got cut on the head and was bleeding like crazy, I looked like I got shot in the face. But despite all that I was smiling because I felt I was going to get a lot of so-called respect from it. The scar on my forehead healed and is no longer visible but I still have a wonky looking finger from my bad punching form.

I became a bit of a celebrity in the group and let it all go to my head. When I started dating Z, it was just weeks until drama happened again. That friend that I mentioned earlier who was one of her exes, he got into some goofy drama with her so I went through the same motions as the last time, it was just deja vu on steroids. I knew that fighting him wasn't a good idea but I did it anyways.

However this fight was different. I didn't lose exactly but we both basically looked like toddlers fighting. It was embarassing and the respect I had immediately disappeared. Even people who weren't in that group or had anything to do with the fight ditched me or just changed personalities out of nowhere.

 There were two ""friends"" I had that acted normal with me until that fight, then all of a sudden they started picking on me, constantly belittling me and bragging about how I'm small and they'd send me to the hospital if we ever fought because they were at least 100 pounds heavier. It was non-stop.

I broke up with Z right after the fight. While I brought the entire situation on myself when you think about it, the sheer domino effect that resulted from that situation still affects me now.



I became extremely insecure about my ability to fight and defend myself. I became untrusting, wary, and angry at people around me. I got obsessed with following martial arts and wanted to be a magically unstoppable god because I didn't like that anybody on Earth could beat me in a fight. I know this all sounds like a supervillain backstory but this was my mind. 

I would get angry at seeing violence in media where someone gets beat up when they didn't deserve it. I hate words like ""ass beating"", ""ass whooping"", ""ass kicking"". I hate words like that because I know what it's like to be in a vulnerable spot like that and to have people say you ""Got your ass beat"", especially if you were a victim, is extremely hurtful but I've never heard of anyone having that same pet peeve as me. It makes me feel alone. 

I wanted to go to the gym, bulk up, and get into fighting. It became a daily obsession that I couldn't get over. I didn't have the drive to actually hit the gym so I just gained an appetite after getting onto a blue-collar job and went from 120 pounds to 160 in a few years. After the next relationship and inevitable breakup, I lost the obsession or drive to fight and become the ""magically unstoppable god"", but the above paragraph still holds true to me now. 

Whenever I would vent about my fighting obsession to people or of how the two ""friends"" I mentioned before treated me, people just invalidated my problem and basically told me to get over it because it was ""tough love and just the way boys talk to each other"".



The issue of the fighting obsession would follow me into the next relationship. In the summer of 2022 I met one of the girls that used to be my elementary school classmate. I'll call her S. We found each other on Instagram and we met at our old elementary. We got together shortly afterwards and the relationship actually started out great. 

It started out loving and caring. She would tell me a lot about her past trauma and family issues. Her dad, Curtis, used to beat her and her brother when they were little. She got cornered by a boy in elementary, in the restroom, she didn't tell me any more details, all the kids at school made fun of her over it and called her weird. She would tell me about her ex problems, like one about how she broke up with a guy who proceeded to stalk her at her house and Curtis chased him away and threatened to shove a gun up his ass.

There were a couple things that weren't clear to me at first; How the abuse and trauma affected S and how her dad was treating her. The turmoil that would happen in the relationship comes down to my unresolved problems and hers as well. Also a lack of meeting in person. Most of the relationship was on Instagram because we could barely get any chances to see each other.

At first, I didn't recognize the terrible way her dad was treating her. He was always nice to me the whole time and at the beginning of the relationship the verbal abuse was very subtle, but it quickly became a lot less so. He would always yell and scream at S for any little reason possible, and always framed it as tough love and ""telling it how it is"". He said one time ""life is too short to be nice to people"".

Apparently the physical abuse of her childhood stopped when her mom got fed up with it but it just turned into verbal abuse afterwards. However, one time while we were together (in the relationship) her dad hit her, pulled her hair, and hit her mom over a stupid argument. 

She had lots of health problems for someone who was 19, like arthritis, carpel tunnel, and alpha gal syndrome. She couldn't eat much meat and her health was going downhill. They had an argument about medicine and I guess he got mad enough to hit people.

It was awkward having to go over to his house and pretend nothing happened. I wanted to fight him but I had finally learned from the first two fights that it wouldn't be worth it. I'd either get beat up, or shot. I hated that all I could do was just ignore the whole situation, I hate the powerlessness of it.

That was the gist of that whole situation, but the relationship still remained strong for awhile. However the honeymoon phase ended in just a few months, and as the arguments began, the relationship became chaotic from there. The arguments looking back were very minor, in a normal relationship these would not have been big deals at all. 

One example, I had vented to her one time about my fighting obsession and she gave me advice, but part of the advice was that you can't win every fight and that to become a better fighter you have to get ""fucked up to fuck somebody up"". I didn't want to hear that because I wanted to instantly be unstoppable. I never wanted to feel the embarrassment and other people's shame at me losing a fight. 

She said that if I didn't like the advice and didn't want to lose, then I didn't want to fight. She was basically saying that if I couldn't handle losing, I shouldn't be a fighter, which is true, but the issue here is that I don't think she fully comprehended my problem, and I didn't at the time either. 

Everything I'm writing here I'm able to because I've had a lot of time to personally grow and figure out my own mind. I never wanted to be a fighter, I just wanted to be left alone for once in my life. She thought I just wanted to fight but that was just all a way of coping. The argument escalated and I got exhausted from it and cut it off. She got upset about that and asked ""Are you going to go to sleep every time we have an argument?"". 

I basically said ""No but this argument is stressing me out too much, I need a break"" and she called me a dickhead and said if I didn't want to talk to her then I shouldn't ever talk to her. Then all of that ended. I could barely sleep that night, when I woke up I sent an apology to her and went to work dreading the breakup to happen. 

She texted me back eventually and said ""I want to give you a hug. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have called you a dickhead I was just so upset"". We made up after that and the relationship actually seemed stronger afterwards, but now that I can look back I know that it was a big crack in the foundation. That was the beginning of a chaotic and up-and-down rest of the relationship. We didn't have many arguments, but they were all pretty stupid.

There was one where me, S, and her friends were in a group chat. I almost had to go to jury duty one time but I wasn't picked. I sent the chat the pic of the confirmation but S let me know I had my address in there on accident so I deleted it. 

She told me to be careful and not give out info like that and I was like ""Ok, but it's alright. If you're friends with them I'm sure it wouldn't have ended bad"". Then she repeated what she said and I repeated and we kept going over and over about it. When the argument was finally over we apologized again and that was the end of that.

Another argument was a really goofy one, about what you call different Japanese swords. It's hard to remember what this was all about. We were talking about katanas and somehow we got into it about that and she kept calling different swords different names, but you try and look them up the names are nowhere to be found. 

We kept going on and on about it and it escalated. I sent her a Wikipedia article about Japanese swords and she dismissed it like ""Wikipedia is an unreliable source"", like every single article is incorrect, to the point where even definitions of words are all incorrect just because it's Wikipedia 🤣. 

We went on and on and I got so tired of it that I said something that was admittedly stupid. I was like ""Are you on drugs?"" That made her angry and she said ""You're making me feel stupid, I know what I'm talking about"". I don't remember anything else from that confusing argument, but it ended the same way the others did. 

Now, onto what ended the relationship. I went over to her dad's house and he was talking about fighting, how we grew up small so he had to learn how to fight. He bragged about being 140 pounds, and being in over 200 fights and only losing 4. 

He talked about how his son accidentially knocked into him once which made him black out in rage and threw his son against the wall. He talked about almost knocking his son out one time. He'd always say he never hits women even though that evidently wasn't true and one time he had an attitude with S, which she gave back to him and he got mad and said ""I'd never hit a woman but I want to"".

In the discussion about fighting, he said ""If any of my kids get their asses beat they can't come home"". That threw me off but I just acted one ear and out the other. When I got home I texted her and complained about the shit he was saying. She said ""Yeah but I wouldn't have it any other way, it's just tough love"". 

She always complained about her dad's parenting and how he contributed to her trauma. But now all of a sudden a switch is flipped and she defends him? I always felt like people just toy with me all of my life, and this triggered that feeling. 

I got upset about that and kept asking what he could mean by that. I said he's a piece of shit who'd abandon his kids (I didn't say the piece of shit part but I wanted to). She kept arguing that I ""Didn't understand, he doesn't just mean physical, but mental fights as well"" like that makes anything better. I kept asking what any of that even means and said that was all bullshit and she kept repeating herself. So it escalated and I eventually gave up and shut the argument down.

The relationship was hanging by a thread at that point. The last straw was when I was on my first time on call at work. I was very nervous because I haven't done it before and never had to communicate with people like that. It was nearing the 4th of July so S asked me to take time off of on call to go to her brother's house for the party. 

I didn't know at the time that you could ask a coworker to switch with you, so I just told her ""I don't know if my dad (who's my boss) will allow that, but I'll check later and see what he says"" and then she said ""Well go check now"" and I said ""I will in a little bit"". 

Then she said ""No go check now because you won't"". I repeated what I said and she repeated again, then we kept on repeating and repeating. I eventually got fed up and told her to ""Stop bugging me about this"". Then she got angry and told me I'm ""Acting like a little kid"". Awhile after that I got a call and had my completely stressed mind preoccupied on that so I left her on read accidentially and when I got back home she had texted me to ""Never talk to her again and don't dare to go to her brother's house"". 

I told her I got called so I couldn't reply, and she told me ""if you won't get therapy this relationship won't last long"". I frantically tried to salvage the relationship so I agreed to go to therapy and to get into martial arts. The argument ended there and she thanked me.

But a day or two after that, she texted that she ""wanted to talk"" so I immediately knew what that meant and was filled with dread. She sent me the breakup text. I started begging, ""That was the last argument! I swear I'm going to get help, I'm sorry"" to which she said ""Stop saying you're sorry I hate when people say they're sorry, you just don't want to lose me"". 

That was correct. I told her I wanted to still be friends and she said ""It'll take awhile to trust you again but I think eventually we could be friends again"". But I didn't want to be friends, that was a desperate act to be with her again in any way. Right after the breakup, I just stared and dissociated for multiple minutes until I finally got up and told my mom. We went on vacation the week after, to Wyoming/Utah/Colorado. Great vacation.

I didn't want to tell anyone about the situation because I couldn't explain or wrap my head around it. She made me feel like I was the bad guy the whole time. I've had a couple years to wrap my head around it and now I know the reality of the situation is just very grey. I'm still angry about this, why did I have to go through relationship troubles all because everyone wants to treat me like trash, then I get blamed for it, told I'm just overreacting to everything?

I kept S in contact but a week or two after we broke up she had already put ""Taken"" on her Instagram. I don't know if it was real or not but that reaffirmed the feeling of being manipulated and played with by everybody, so I instantly blocked her and haven't heard from her since. 



Post-breakup, the desperation and yearning for a new relationship immediately surfaced again, and hasn't went away. Even almost two years later, I can't stop thinking about the past relationship, I still get dreams about her or her dad. Every girl I see that's even slightly attractive, I fantasize about having sex and being in a relationship with them. 

I wish I didn't view every girl with desires, but I can't get any of it out of my head. Whenever I find out a girl I'm interested in is already in a relationship, I get depressed. I'm depressed, lonely, and touch-starved every day. Every weekend I ruminate and cry, while holding myself, playing with my own hair, and hugging the pillow, wishing it was a person.

In the absense of connection with others, I have imagined the perfect friends, who always give me affection, who listen to all of my problems, who have similar values and minds as me. I don't get any of this with anybody I know. I feel disconnected from everyone. It feels like everybody is secretly plotting against me, like I'm in The Truman Show. Despite this, I still keep a side of hoping I'm wrong and a public act of seeming normal to everybody else.

I saw someone online talking about how they have a friend group that sleeps over together and cuddles to sleep every night. That story stuck with me, that is another aspect of the ""perfect friends"" I dream of. I wish I had that.

I had a dream of these friends once. It was us going on some type of adventure at some indescribable fantasy city. Every person there was made up, I've never seen them before, but one was familiar. 

There was a girl at my high school I was friends with because they were friends with someone I knew. I didn't know them much but when she killed herself, I cried and still to this day I imagine if she was still alive. I don't know why I care about her that much but I guess it's because she's the only one who asked how I was after a breakup. 

Nobody else even cared to ask how I was doing or of what happened, other than my mom, but she did. Why did one of the only people in my life who showed such care to me have to die?

I never get the opportunity to vent and tell my stories to anyone, and whenever I did, it always felt like they weren't actually listening. I don't just feel alone socially, but mentally, I have never seen or heard of anyone with issues particularly like mine, or viewpoints like mine. Is there nobody else like me in the world?



Going back in time a bit, I've heard about a lot of people who have suffered brain fog or some type of cognitive decline when COVID happened. This is relevant because I have suffered a bit of a decline as well. Not during COVID, I was actually doing better than ever when the pandemic happened, but nearing the end of high school, my mind just suddenly weakened.

My grades slipped and I barely graduated, my short-term memory tanked, and since graduating and especially since the last breakup, I have felt like I entered a different dimension. ""Reality"" since the pandemic feels like a simulation. I'm being kept prisoner in my mind, and in a world I don't recognize. My brain seems like an old computer with tons of malware. I don't process information correctly and it makes working difficult.

Not only does it seem like my mind is slowly rotting away, but physically I feel like I'm rotting away. Every time I've gotten sick since last year, I keep having Bronchitis attacks, coughing and gagging on mucas forever until I get medication for it. I don't know why this keeps happening to me. 

There's always red bumps (like bug bites or something) that pop up on my body and they'll stay for a long time. I don't have any bed bugs in the house so I have no idea where these bites come from.



I grew up on the internet since I was 10 years old back in 2013, using it for hours every day. Being on the internet for that long is an indescribable experience, you feel like you have lived another life concurrent with your normal life. Just recently, 11 years later, I have finally started to withdrawl from this addiction and have made steps to replace social media.

I think all the drama and failed relationships, as well as the years-long buildup of feeling a lack of connection with other people finally woke me up to start rethinking everything in my life. I always used the internet to make life more exciting, to have more connection with people, but it never gave me any connection. All of my internet life has been spent on scrolling, watching videos, and arguing with people. 

I never realized how toxic this all was until this year, when I would try to vent to people and to my ""friends"" about everything and would either be ignored or invalidated. I got tired of being ignored, constantly arguing with people online about stupid shit, and viewing brain rot ""content"". 

I deleted Twitter (I'm not calling it X, fuck off with that porn name, Elon) and Instagram. I used Reddit religiously and subbed to over a hundred subreddits but I cut it down to a few. The only reason I still use Reddit is because I'm big into Lostwave so I follow those communities but other than that I don't use it much. I mainly still use YouTube a lot which I'm trying to decrease. I watched a ton of commentary slop and political channels and I've cut those out and refined everything I watch.

If only I had those friends I dream of, I could finally gain the will to cut the internet out entirely. That's all hard to do when technology is all you have to make life worth living.",long story putting see anyone relate let know im alone elementary early high school bullied always tiny quiet white

1h98xih,2024-12-08T03:39:39,"Bored with life at 27. Is this just getting older? Or is it something more serious?
Never really posted on anything like this but I do feel like I need help. I look around my life and everything is pretty good. I’m happily married for almost 2 years, have good friends, a good job. A comfortable place to live and family who still loves and cares for me.

However most days I find myself questioning every decision I’ve made in my life and just feeling bored and depressed with the routine. I go to work, come home, and make dinner. I watch football or basketball and kiss my wife goodnight. We take our dog for walks. Plans with friends or family every 6 weeks or so. I’m tired a lot. Things are good and I want it to be enough but I’m always hearing voices in my head telling me I’m wasting the peak years of my life. I love to cook and exercise but my wife has a lot of dietary restrictions and doesn’t enjoy exercising. Schedules never line up to do fun things with friends. Not very interested in doing some of the things I used to do. Finding myself sexually frustrated since I’ve been with my wife since 19 but I feel like I’m in the best physical & sexual condition I’ve ever been in. Constantly horny and sometimes thinking about other women. 

Just feel like I’m still at the bottom of the ladder of a life I’m not really interested in climbing, but things are so stable I feel ungrateful and scared when I consider starting over. Sometimes I’m not even sure if these thoughts are my actual own feelings or just depression knit picking at my life. Perhaps this is just what you have to deal with when you settle down, but I’m not sure if this is what I want to do for the next 30-40 years.

It’s driving me insane and I’m not sure if I can continue like this. Any advice would be helpful.

1h57ek7,2024-12-02T23:12:31,"I have NO idea what’s wrong with me 
Please take time to read this, I have no idea who to talk to.
I’m 18 and almost done with my first semester of college. Yet I am struggling in the weirdest ways, I have never cried so much before ever in my life. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve always been an emotional and sentimental person but this is extreme and it’s mainly when I’m in college, away from home. I chose a college around 20 minutes away from my home since I know I am very close with my mother and sister and that moving further would be too painful, it has always been just the 3 of us at home, (im the older sibling). There’s other people who live really far from home yet they seem to be doing fine, they’re adapting and ready to move on in life and grow up. I feel like I’m suffocating every time I come back to my dorm. 

The thing is, I know that I am so extremely privileged to be able to get an education at a decent school and am so grateful that my parents agreed to help me pay, yet I feel so depressed here sometimes in ways that I really don’t want to be which makes me feel like a waste of space and shell of a person. I feel horrible for making people pay for me to experience what is supposed to be one of the best parts of your life yet being kind of miserable even though I’m trying so hard to see the good and have fun. I don’t party, but it’s just not my thing… I don’t think that if I did it would change anything. I talk to people and have tried to put myself out there (despite still having social anxiety) and I barely have friends or genuine connections. Ultimately, I feel like a failure… like I am living life wrong and I have no idea how to fix it or figure out what I should be doing and I am so painfully alone. I have always had times where I feel awful about myself and question everything about life in general but something about being at my dorm triggers it. 

My dorm is in a beautiful city that I do take time to explore during the day and during those moments I’m relatively okay… then I get to the dorm and I feel like a dark shadow swallows me or something (excuse my dramatic-ness, I’m trying to paint a full picture of how I feel.) IMPORTANTLY, I miss my family to an extreme level that feels sick. I look at all the stuff that they have given me, that I brought from home and I start thinking about them nonstop and how I would choose being around them any day over being at this dorm. But I can’t be attached and depend on them forever, eventually my sister will also start her own life and I will be left alone. My mother questions why I’m so sad and I want to be strong and say that I am so f*cking happy to be in college but I have never been more lost and lonely and sentimental. I start crying over almost every little thing. I feel like a literal baby who can’t be away from home. I wanna be strong and grow up and whatever but I simply can’t. Sometimes I walk past people with their dogs and start tearing up thinking about mine. You’d think my entire family died or something. Seriously, I hate how sensitive I’ve become. I keep thinking about growing up and getting older and growing farther from the people of your childhood and childhood itself. I just want to be a kid forever. I genuinely can’t see myself ever having my own house or life or anything, I can’t even be alone in a beautiful dorm without feeling absolutely empty and hopeless and aimless in life… what’s actually wrong with me? I miss my family that lives legitimately 20 minutes away so much. I have intentionally held back on eating some of the food my mom bought me because I want to cherish it. Hell, I’m tearing up writing this. 

Life just feels like its full of so many hurdles and whatnot and right now I can’t even jump the first even though its literally only an inch high and I hate myself for this. I know that everyone has their own lives and struggles and that you cannot judge on what you see on the surface, yet they all seem so happy meanwhile I’m sad over seemingly nothing and being so stupid and childish making problems for myself. I can’t even think about the future and what cool things could be in store for me, I just think about the past and all the memories I have with the ones I love, I feel like I can’t so anything. I’ve been depressed before and I don’t know if this is some weird form of depression but it all just feels so hopeless. Why am I one of the only sad people? Why am I so pathetic that all I think about is my mother at the grand age of 18. Sometimes when I distract myself and walk around and watch stuff and whatever I can be happy and sometimes my brain feels clear and I appreciate what I have a bit more. It’s not like life is hell all of the time. But it always crashes down since I’ve been here. Whenever I wake up at home I’m fine but when I wake up here my heart is racing. Like actually, I feel like a defected fragment of a person who will never have anything going for myself. I’m so lost, like how am I going to manage myself? I’m an adult now… what about when my parents die? The world is so big and I feel like an ant who anyone could step on. I’ve never felt so sentimental and easy to break before. If you actually read this repetitive rant thank you. I’m just lost in life. I really don’t know what’s wrong with me and if this will pass but it hasn’t. And I can’t keep going home and denying the adult-like and lonely future ahead of me. I want to go back in time and freeze it. It’s like it’s the end of the world and I’m a joke. I feel like I’m doing life wrong.

1h34t4q,2024-11-30T05:44:47,"I think I almost got close to crying on Thanksgiving.
For reference, the last time I cried was in 2011. It was either January or February. I was 13. I don't remember the month, but I know my birthday didn't come yet because I was going to turn 14 on March 6th. A Language Arts teacher I respected ridiculed me unprovoked. I felt betrayed, disrespected, and humiliated. So I cried. But more importantly, I felt weak. I felt so weak that I thought that I must never feel that way again. The next time I felt close to crying was the school year after when I was in an AP Human Geography because people in my second semester class would always tell me to shut up because they thought I was annoying. Even the teacher was annoyed by me asking questions. Only 4 people (3 girls and 1 boy) were nice to me. I felt devastated each day, but never cried. I did, however, just end up not speaking for the rest of the semester and failed the class.

To the main point of this post. It started during the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. When the Sesame Street float was on the screen, they played the song, ""Sing"" which is the one that goes like this:

Sing  
Sing a song  
Sing out loud  
Sing out strong  
Sing of good things, not bad  
Sing of happy, not sad  
Sing  
Sing a song  
Make it simple  
To last your whole life long  
Don't worry that it's not good enough  
For anyone else to hear  
Sing  
Sing a song

When I heard the ""Sing of happy, not sad"" part, that was when it hit me. I don't even know what it was. Maybe it is because I've been stressed out on things like getting into graduate school for the past 2 years since graduating in 2022 with a bachelor's and the overall feeling of feeling incomplete (especially considering it took too long to even get the bachelor's from 2015 to 2022 because incompetent school workers tried helping me and messed me up). Maybe it was other aspects in my life like having to deal with multiple deaths this year or the fact that I have dealt with many friends and people near my age dying since I was a freshman in high school. I don't know, but I felt this sudden feeling of intense sadness over a song that's supposed to be happy in nature. I know some people might say that it was just a nostalgia hit or something, but no; I had an overwhelming feeling of dread and sadness over a song that's supposed to be a happy song. I wasn't necessary longing for something because I didn't have the happiest childhood due to a sometimes abusive father, occasional issues with brothers and mother, and bullying in school. Or maybe I was sad because it caused me to think of said childhood because the Muppets and people on the float looked so happy. The ""Don't worry that it's not good enough"" part also hit me hard, probably because I've been feeling inadequate and incomplete for a while.

Maybe this was pointless, but I just wanted to get this out. I haven't cried in over 13 years and it's not something I necessarily pride in. I wish I could stop associating the act of me crying with me feeling weak. I cried a lot when I was a kid because certain things moved me, but crying made me feel weak and vulnerable every time I did.",think almost got close crying thanksgiving reference last time cried 2011 either january february 13 dont remember month know birthday didnt come yet going turn 14 march 6th language arts teacher respected ridiculed unprovoked felt betrayed disrespected humiliated cried importantly felt weak felt weak thought must never feel way next time felt close crying school year ap human geography people second semester class would always tell shut thought annoying even teacher annoyed asking questions 4 people 3 girls 1 boy nice felt devastated day never cried however end speaking rest semester failed class main point post started macys thanksgiving day parade sesame street float screen played song sing one goes like sing sing song sing loud sing strong sing good things bad sing happy sad sing sing song make simple last whole life long dont worry good enough anyone else hear sing sing song heard sing happy sad part hit dont even know maybe ive stressed things like getting graduate school past 2 years since graduating 2022 bachelors overall feeling feeling incomplete especially considering took long even get bachelors 2015 2022 incompetent school workers tried helping messed maybe aspects life like deal multiple deaths year fact dealt many friends people near age dying since freshman high school dont know felt sudden feeling intense sadness song thats supposed happy nature know people might say nostalgia hit something overwhelming feeling dread sadness song thats supposed happy song wasnt necessary longing something didnt happiest childhood due sometimes abusive father occasional issues brothers mother bullying school maybe sad caused think said childhood muppets people float looked happy dont worry good enough part also hit hard probably ive feeling inadequate incomplete maybe pointless wanted get havent cried 13 years something necessarily pride wish could stop associating act crying feeling weak cried lot kid certain things moved crying made feel weak vulnerable every time,1,0,0,Neutral,Low
1h33xgr,2024-11-30T04:53:57,"Wow such great friends I have!
I have such great friends! I am getting so tired of this ungrateful and quite rude friends I seem to have accumulated. After all I do to help them they just ignore me when I clearly want someone to at least check on how I am feeling, for once. A little bit of background info on what’s going on, I am going through a lot for a very long time and I just want to get away from it but if I even think of telling a ‘trusted adult’ or just someone who can do something I am threatened? Like what type of reaction is that to someone trying to ask for just a little advice!

I am going to split this into section before I start to rant about life and say a little too much.

My friends rn are all in a group chat which I made so we can have a big community of people that is able to help one another. But to be frank it seems the others aren’t that interested in being caring at all they always give half- responses or just an “ok sorry” pretty much just makes it worse for mental wounds and I know none of the people in this group chat are perfectly fine. Some of them don’t talk in the chat anymore. But the thing that really angers me is how much I put into everyone, I tell when I’m not going to be able to respond to them, they even go to me with their problems, and after doing so much to make it a safe place for everyone in the chat. I am just mad rn because I do everything to help them, I make time for them, and it costs me so much I could get in serious trouble with my school or parents if I end up being called because someone want to talk at a awful time and I forgot to say something. A lot of these friends I am upset with aren’t even my age, and they are older and have much more life experience then me but it seems as tho I am the only person with responsibility? I kinda hope one of them sees this just so they can finally understand how much I put into them. I feel betrayed but Ik that’s the wrong word but it just hurts to know that you will put everything on the line to just help one person you don’t know that well just to see them happy, but they won’t even acknowledge you when your feeling “bad”. It hurts. 

They don’t know this, well maybe a few friends know about my past, but it not like I won’t talk about it they just have to ask. I have always been having relative “problems” ever since I can remember. Do you know what that can do to a person? I am still dealing with it but slightly different now. But it still involves my relatives. One of my friends were literally dealing with the same thing but for a shorter period of time but worse behavior. I just hoped that maybe I could have gotten a little “Are you okay?” or maybe a “Wanna talk about it?” but no I was just ignored and sure it wasn’t about the relative issues but it was still something that was bothering me. It’s not that much just every time I think about working on a video like for Instagram pre YouTube I start to tremble as if I’m scared to start making it, and how not being creative as an artist has been taking a toll on my mental health.

No I can’t talk to much people about this because as I said I get threatened when I do, I don’t think it’s intended to be that way, or it can also just be straight out rude things to say to someone trying to express something around you. Why can’t people be a little bit more empathetic when someone’s trying to express hardship? I have so many questions. Why do I laugh when in pain or sad? Or why do I cry when mad? It doesn’t add up. If I am nice to you for a very long time don’t you feel at least a little remorse for me? I don’t spect much I just want someone who cares for me enough to ask how my day was and for me to be able to answer with a true statement not just “fine/good”. Maybe it stems from something else I don’t quite know. 

Thanks for reading this “vent”(?) I just had to get it out because if I keep bottling it, and pushing is down I might start getting worse and can’t help anyone. I like being their for people, as weird as it sounds I want to hear others pain and I want to be there to listen. I feel as though I have became that person but at what cost? My own health? Why can’t I just be able to help others and have that same person for me? Is that really fair for me and others that do the same thing or as a coping mechanism.",wow great friends great friends getting tired ungrateful quite rude friends seem accumulated help ignore clearly want someone least check feeling little bit background info whats going going lot long time want get away even think telling trusted adult someone something threatened like type reaction someone trying ask little advice going split section start rant life say little much friends rn group chat made big community people able help one another frank seems others arent interested caring always give half responses ok sorry pretty much makes worse mental wounds know none people group chat perfectly fine dont talk chat anymore thing really angers much put everyone tell im going able respond even go problems much make safe place everyone chat mad rn everything help make time costs much could get serious trouble school parents end called someone want talk awful time forgot say something lot friends upset arent even age older much life experience seems tho person responsibility kinda hope one sees finally understand much put feel betrayed ik thats wrong word hurts know put everything line help one person dont know well see happy wont even acknowledge feeling bad hurts dont know well maybe friends know past like wont talk ask always relative problems ever since remember know person still dealing slightly different still involves relatives one friends literally dealing thing shorter period time worse behavior hoped maybe could gotten little okay maybe wanna talk ignored sure wasnt relative issues still something bothering much every time think working video like instagram pre youtube start tremble im scared start making creative artist taking toll mental health cant talk much people said get threatened dont think intended way also straight rude things say someone trying express something around cant people little bit empathetic someones trying express hardship many questions laugh pain sad cry mad doesnt add nice long time dont feel least little remorse dont spect much want someone cares enough ask day able answer true statement finegood maybe stems something else dont quite know thanks reading vent get keep bottling pushing might start getting worse cant help anyone like people weird sounds want hear others pain want listen feel though became person cost health cant able help others person really fair others thing coping mechanism,1,3,0,Neutral,Low

1gpyn7i,2024-11-13T00:22:07,"Anxiety/student/Triggering Spaces 
I’m a second year university student and I’ve struggled with anxiety ever since I was a child. My anxiety peeked after Covid due to personal circumstances and I found it hard to adjust to the world after months of lockdown. I then started sixth form and my anxiety and shyness became worse, I made no new friends and the pressure to study and continue being the best occupied my life for 2 years. 

I then started uni and thought I was doing better but yet again I struggled to make friends and found anxiety taking over my life. I continued studying hard and that distracted me for some time until summer. 

I had the worse summer of my life, filled with anxiety, worry, guilt and just pure fear because I didn’t get the exact grades I wanted, I got a work experience purely through connections which filled me with this guilt. I couldn’t relax even when I went on holiday and barely ate the whole time I was there. I also started having these intense panic attacks which led to another fear- I woke up everyday scared another attack was coming. 

Once I got back to uni again I thought things would get better because I’d get busy again and could focus on studying. But there hasn’t been a day since this summer where I haven’t felt physically sick from anxiety and worry. And this is all because I’m so terrified of the future. I’ve put myself under this pressure to get a training contract by 3rd year and start working because of if I don’t I’m a massive failure. I constantly feel like time is running out and whatever reassurance I try give myself fails miserably. 

And because of that horrible summer I have started to associate all those horrible things I felt with where I felt them most… at home. 

I’ve come back home just for 2 days for the first time since summer and I was excited to come back and see my family. And then ever since I got here I’ve been holding back tears. I feel so anxious when I’m here and I feel terrible because this is supposed to be my home with my family. But I want to go back to my room at uni desperately, that’s the only place where I can feel anxious and it doesn’t get too overwhelming because I know I’m by myself and I’m safe. 

I don’t really know what this is or why I’m writing this but I feel so lost. I don’t know how to slow down and I don’t want to be afraid to come back to my own home. I guess I’ll just leave this out there and maybe just writing this down will lift some stress off my shoulders.

I'm at the point where even when someone says something that is meant to be funny it triggers me and makes me really upset

I always have to reach out to people for any social activities and never asked to attend social gatherings.

Hi everyone,

I’m looking for some reassurance and perspective on a situation that’s been weighing on me.

There’s a local café I’ve been visiting frequently for about a year, and I’ve developed a strong connection with the owner. Her café feels like a safe space, and she’s been incredibly kind and supportive. I’ve even shared with her that I’m autistic, which she’s been very understanding about.

Recently, I’ve been struggling with overthinking about whether I’m overstepping any boundaries or annoying her by visiting too often. I sent her a message expressing my gratitude and how much her café means to me, and she responded warmly, saying I “always have a place here in all our hearts.” This was very reassuring, but I still find myself overthinking and worrying that I might be a burden.

I’m planning to give her a bit of space for a few days before visiting again, just to help ease my anxiety and make sure I’m being respectful of her boundaries. I care deeply about this connection and want to handle it thoughtfully, but I could really use some reassurance that I’m not overstepping.
