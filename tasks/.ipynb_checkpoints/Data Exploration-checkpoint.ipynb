Sometimes you feel confident that you got them, but sometimes, you just want to run to your parents desperately afraid of making a mistake that may cost you a great deal. My 20s have been tough with a whole lot of life quakes I am not prepared for. Maybe my MDD, anxiety disorder and C-PTSD could be amplifying it, but big stressors nonetheless. I don't enjoy all the painful struggles, but maybe I took the moments in between for granted when I looked at the bigger picture. Underneath all the struggle, I had moments of joy, quiet, and success that my mind drowned out in favor of all the chaos. My mind can’t stop being hyper-vigilant because of all the stress.\n",

      "I impulsively went out today because I wanted to take my mind off the decision to finally leave my job. I decided to go to a store so I could buy my friends at work goodbye presents for when I leave, and then I felt a sense of “warm sadness” seeing all the little toys and trinkets- Barbie, Carebears, Disney, Sanrio, Harry Potter, among other things that reminded me of my childhood. Suddenly, I was reminiscing on my “baby years”. I didn't have the easiest childhood, but my god I miss how much simpler everything was. Despite the difficulties, my imagination made me feel unstoppable. I miss being a 9-year-old with her Pokemon and I miss being a 15-year-old with her daily film binge-watching. But then, sometimes I don’t understand why I long for my younger years when I was struggling  back then.\n",

Landing my first job, traveling the world, going out with my friends often, getting the butterflies with romantic connections, dinners with my family, among other pleasures. Of course, these pleasures still exist today in my life, but I have grown much more afraid. The last few months showed me how fragile everything is. Anything and anyone you love can disappear without warning. Everything becomes a matter of survival. We have to do what we can to get by and it is a privilege to actually be able to do the things you want. At this point, we all want stability, peace, to be loved and cared for, to be healthy, and to be able to wake up the next day hoping that it’s a good day much more than we ever did. I just miss and long for some quietness.\n",

I'm worried sick about her, one time she said she wouldn't come to school for a while and I just broke down. When she came back, she looked terrible, with literally black rings under her eyes. I want to help but I don't know how.\n",

Nonetheless, I still want her to know she's not alone and that I want to be there for her, because I know she's struggling a lot. We're both 19 and in our senior year, but there's no chance I could speak to her alone at school, so I thought about sending her long text when the holidays start, so I don't have to put her in an uncomfortable position by confronting her about it face to face. Does anyone have any advice? I love her so much and I can't bear to think about her hurting herself and I want to be there for her so badly. Any advice is greatly appreciated <3\n",
