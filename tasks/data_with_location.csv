1jmheax,2025-03-29T08:55:47,"I think about it everyday.
TW before you read: Self-harm, suicidal thoughts, and violence...

Hello. I just need to talk since mental health in my community is considered taboo and a topic that people avoid all together. I am diagnosed clinical depression, severe anxiety and PTSD by many doctors. However, in most recent years I noticed a big shift in my emotions and how I handle them. I've gotten better with dealing with anxiety which helped me get over being in public. Though, I have these outbursts of extreme anger and sadness when I have a bad day or just out of nowhere. It went as far as me destroying my room and hurting myself in the process. I even have these extreme intrusive thoughts of hurting others and seeing them in pain just because I'm upset. I've brought this up to my therapist and psychiatrist, which both responded with ""that is normal with depression"". But I feel like it's not. In a way it affects me to the point where I don't leave my room days on end because I'm terrified of hurting people or my dogs. I feel like I'm spiraling out of control and I lost all progress I tried to make as an adult. It doesn't help that others around me always have something negative to say and it's extreme hard for me to make friends. I do try very hard but I feel like there's nothing changing. I've tried moving to a different city and changing my whole life around but it seems useless. I don't feel like I belong here anymore and it's getting too much to bear. I really don't know what to do at this point. Thanks for reading.

Hi there! To keep it short I‚Äôm a very anxious individual my thoughts never stops wether they be good or bad, I go through phases where I feel like there‚Äôs no point in being alive. We are put on this earth against our will, then we are forced to work to survive and all we get out of it is a 2 week unpaid vacation. At the end of our working lives we are left to retire for a few years with a shitty pension until a disease kills us because there is cancer in everything we eat. In the process, the rich get richer while 95% of the population is stuck in this ‚Äúwork to survive‚Äù cycle, with everything going on in politics right now it‚Äôs brought some things into perspective. And systems that are out in place to benefit us in governments ex: healthcare, education, food system governance, are put in place to make the rich richer.

I realize this is an extreme way of thinking but at the end of the day it isn‚Äôt wrong. My parents immigrated to Canada from Brazil 25 years ago, my mom is 57 and my dad is 60. They are not retired. They came to this country with nothing and worked their butts off. Why shouldn‚Äôt everybody work their butts off? I‚Äôm tired of tone deaf politicians not serving their people.

Hey everyone,

I stopped taking my anxiety meds almost five months ago, thinking I could manage without them. Initially, I felt okay, but now I can see the effects catching up to me. My anxiety is worse than ever, and it‚Äôs seriously affecting my daily life.

My speech is slurred, and people mishear me all the time.

My memory is terrible‚ÄîI can‚Äôt retain or learn new things.

I keep avoiding social situations, which makes people think I‚Äôm weird.

Mornings are awful; I wake up tense and anxious about the day ahead.

Even after getting enough sleep, I feel mentally and physically exhausted.

My hands shake in stressful situations‚Äîlike today at the supermarket, when I struggled to pull money from my pocket.


The only temporary relief I get is from the gym, but it doesn‚Äôt last long.

I was thinking of restarting therapy and meds, but my parents are against medication and barely tolerate therapy. When I first started, there was resentment, but they eventually agreed. However, going through that battle again is exhausting, and I don‚Äôt know how to convince them.

At this point, I feel stuck and scared because my anxiety is making me non-functional. Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? Any advice on getting back into treatment while dealing with unsupportive family?

Would really appreciate any insights.

At a very young age I fell deeply in love. We were teenagers, and after a couple years her family moved over 6 hours away. We stayed in touch through handwritten letters, emails, phone calls, and we took trips to be able to visit one another... but ultimately after 5 years of this, I knew one particular visit was going to be the last time we got together. I'm pretty sure we both knew this, though neither of us said so.

She needed to invest in the new life she had where she was now living, and we were giving up too many opportunities for something that was logistically not going to work out. Though we still cared for one another greatly, when we said goodbye that time that was our last visit, and we stopped reaching out.

I stopped pining for her many years ago, though she always will have a place in my heart.

Since then I've had numerous opportunities come my way for new relationships, even though I've never sought any out.

I've been asked out multiple times over the years, been propositioned numerous times by different women in my life, and been told unprompted by multiple women I know that someone would be very lucky to have me as their partner.

But the problem is I can't for the life of me figure out what I even want. It changes constantly. Monthly. Weekly. Daily. Even *within* the *same day*.

I won't be interested in relationships *at all* in one moment, then I'll be imagining being in one with one or another of the women in my life I know may be receptive. I'll have no feelings for someone I know over months or even years, then suddenly feelings come on strong and I find myself struggling to figure out why? Why now? Then those feelings will randomly dissipate just as easily. I'll feel super close and happy with a platonic friendship, but then they get a partner and I'll suddenly get feelings show up and feel all depressed. Yet then when they're single I'm back to no interest again. I even went a long stretch where I was essentially asexual and aromantic, not experiencing any attraction or interest at all (hormones were fine - got tested).

I don't understand any of this... what is wrong with me?

The only relationship I ever felt stable about was that one I mentioned at the beginning of my post. My feelings never wavered, and my wishes for a long future together never changed - not once - over those years we were together.

**TL;DR:** Aside from one huge relationship early in life, I've never been able to figure out what it is I'm looking for from a relationship. My romantic feelings, degrees of interests, and wants seem to change like the weather and I don't know how to find that stability again.",42m seem flip place comes im looking cant seem stop young age fell deeply love teenagers couple years family moved 6 hours away stayed touch handwritten letters emails phone calls took trips able visit one another ultimately 5 years knew one particular visit going last time got together im pretty sure knew though neither us said needed invest new life living giving many opportunities something logistically going work though still cared one another greatly said goodbye time last visit stopped reaching stopped pining many years ago though always place heart since ive numerous opportunities come way new relationships even though ive never sought ive asked multiple times years propositioned numerous times different women life told unprompted multiple women know someone would lucky partner problem cant life figure even want changes constantly monthly weekly daily even within day wont interested relationships one moment ill imagining one one another women life know may receptive ill feelings someone know months even years suddenly feelings come strong find struggling figure feelings randomly dissipate easily ill feel super close happy platonic friendship get partner ill suddenly get feelings show feel depressed yet theyre single im back interest even went long stretch essentially asexual aromantic experiencing attraction interest hormones fine got tested dont understand wrong relationship ever felt stable one mentioned beginning post feelings never wavered wishes long future together never changed years together tldr aside one huge relationship early life ive never able figure im looking relationship romantic feelings degrees interests wants seem change like weather dont know find stability,2,1,0,Neutral,Low,[],[]

This happened because i couldnt get myself to get out of bed in the morning at get to the lectures, and if i somehow managed to get there i would not be mentally present, and in the exam period i could not get myself to study for the exams, and the exams i did manage to study for i would simply not remember what i studied, like i would read a page in a book and not be able to recall anything.

- This led me into a cocaine ‚Äúaddiction‚Äù and yes i say ‚Äúaddiction‚Äù because i feel like i can control it and dont do it everyday and crave it constantly, but i used it to focus on my exams. And it helped so much, it was not like it was a euphoric high and a big energy boost, it was more of a ‚Äúmedication‚Äù to make my head and body calm so i didnt have thousands of things going on at the same time, but i could actually just sit down and focus on the task at hand. I started doing cocaine 1,5 years ago, and abput 8 months ago i dropped out of college because i knew that if i needed cocaine to get through it, that might very well be the death of me, because i can feel it impacts my heart a lot to the point where i 1 month ago i went to the ER with heart problems.

- Other than all of this i struggle a lot with regulating what mode im in, like i have an extremely hard time going from calm to active and reverse. Like when i try to sleep i will lay in my bed rolling around for hours before i finally fall asleep, and when i wake up i walk around like a zombie for hours before i feel like i am awake, and then when im awake tho everything goes faster and faster

1jmesi5,2025-03-29T05:49:21,"18M, can someone relate or help tell me what is going on?
These past couple months, I‚Äôve felt a lot different than I used to before November. Not in any good way at all; well kinda.

I consistently imagine that my ex best friends, ex‚Äôs, or really anyone in general are obsessed with me, and I day dream about it a lot. This started around last summer. It‚Äôs to the point where, I believe it, but I question it because I wasn‚Äôt like this before. In fact, I used to be quite insecure and I lacked a lot of confidence. I still do, but I just have this superiority to others that I can‚Äôt let go of. Like, I know I‚Äôm better than the people around me, even though I flaws. I just know I‚Äôm better than them.

More recently, I‚Äôve become a lot more aggressive lately. My boyfriend hangs out with one of my ex best friends from time to time, because they are somewhat close. And every time they hangout, I tend to leave and go home so I don‚Äôt have to be around them. But every time I do, I get so worked up that this friend is gonna try and kiss or do something with my boyfriend, and I can‚Äôt help but want to beat the shit out of‚Äî no, not the friend, but my boyfriend. I don‚Äôt know why. I just want to see his face all battered up to make him understand how I feel when he hangs out with people I don‚Äôt like. Overall, I just get agitated really fast, and the first things that come to mind are beating the shit out of them, or harming them in some way, no matter who it is. Again, this is not something I eve ever thought of or even done before while back.

Also, more recently, as in the past few weeks, I can‚Äôt stop thinking about space and the meaning of life. I‚Äôm stuck in believing that no one around me is actually real, or conscious, and I‚Äôm the only real alive thing in the universe, or, that if everyone around me is real, then I mean absolutely nothing to the other of billions of people in this world, and I need to die. I need to die if I am not known, or popular, or liked.

I have a family history with mental health, and I already have other diagnoses(OCD, depression, anxiety). Because of my age, I‚Äôm not diagnosed with bi-polar, but because of my symptoms and family history I‚Äôm currently taking a mood stabilizer, lamotrigine 100mg. I also have a history of self harm, but I‚Äôve been clean for around half. A year now. But, I have had a lot of urges to in the past few months. Another thing that might be important is that I‚Äôve grown up in a really rough/chaotic home; I‚Äôm a military brat and I‚Äôve moved back to back since I was a kid, until I was about 9 when my dad got medically retired. He is an ex-addict(crack), current alcoholic, and also has a lot of mental health issues. He is and has been abusive, not necessarily physically, but 100% emotionally/verbally. He is also extremely narcissistic. Nothing big/traumatic has happened recently, besides by dad coming home wasted and aggressive, per usual.

That‚Äôs all I have; can someone help me figure what might be going on? I want to understand, because I don‚Äôt.

1jme4tv,2025-03-29T05:07:45,"How do i become normal like you guys?
(I tried posting this several times in subs regarding feminism in male spaces. This is my last attempt seeking help.)

I'm a little tired from this problem, but i keep feeling ashamed and inferior. I don't know what i'm doing wrong yet, but i'm willing to improve nonetheless.

In a thread i posted some months ago i commented about male guilt and shame. A lot of people reached out to help, and every now and then i keep checking the comments. They inspire me, but i feel like i didn't communicate the issue well enough. Forgive me.

Every man i respect follow the feminist movement in a very talented way. They know their studies well, they know how to argue well, and most importantly their feelings are just in the right place. What i mean is that they remain unfazed by statements such as ""i hate men"" or ""i'd pick the bear"", and instead meet these claims with empathy and understanding. I lack in this virtue however, and i wish i knew how to be like this. Normal. Instead i feel all depressed and down all the time i think of stuff like this, even if i'm not guilty at all.

People criticized my coping mechanism regarding this. Basically, i stay quiet and try to tough these feelings out so i don't burden anyone. Problem is, i'm not smart enough to think of anything better.

But i can at least explain myself a little.

Saying ""Not all men"" is a huge nope. Women and men alike made it clear that if you do that you will be effectively shifting focus away from systemic issues and invalidating women's issues, making it about you. I've learned from other's mistakes that this is a bad thing to do objectively.

Saying ""Sorry for being a man"" can easily come out as  a pick-me behaviour that has ulterior motives towards women in hopes to earning their trust to be innapropriate, otherwise it sounds pathetic and makes everyone uncomfortable in general.

What we get from this is that, both saying ""men don't suck"" and ""men suck"" are the wrong choices. I picked the one in-between and stood quiet, but turns out this is also the wrong choice.

What can i do to work towards the right one? Most of you are remarkable individuals who know better than me, so i'd imagine i could get some wisdom from you, bros... Any help is much appreciated.",become normal like guys tried posting several times subs regarding feminism male spaces last attempt seeking help im little tired problem keep feeling ashamed inferior dont know im wrong yet im willing improve nonetheless thread posted months ago commented male guilt shame lot people reached help every keep checking comments inspire feel like didnt communicate issue well enough forgive every man respect follow feminist movement talented way know studies well know argue well importantly feelings right place mean remain unfazed statements hate men id pick bear instead meet claims empathy understanding lack virtue however wish knew like normal instead feel depressed time think stuff like even im guilty people criticized coping mechanism regarding basically stay quiet try tough feelings dont burden anyone problem im smart enough think anything better least explain little saying men huge nope women men alike made clear effectively shifting focus away systemic issues invalidating womens issues making ive learned others mistakes bad thing objectively saying sorry man easily come pickme behaviour ulterior motives towards women hopes earning trust innapropriate otherwise sounds pathetic makes everyone uncomfortable general get saying men dont suck men suck wrong choices picked one inbetween stood quiet turns also wrong choice work towards right one remarkable individuals know better id imagine could get wisdom bros help much appreciated,1,1,0,Neutral,Low,[],[]

I need help. I have been experiencing, what it feels like in my mind, very severe/ abnormal symptoms that have been interfering to the extreme with my daily life. These symptoms have been present for as long as I can remember, but lately it has become nearly unbearable to handle on my own. 

My mothers side of the family all have been diagnosed with one or more extreme mental illnesses which is why I believe this chalks down to some sort of mental disorder(s).

  
I am planning on making an appointment with a psychiatrist soon and I have been writing down a list of these behaviors/ symptoms I believe I may be experiencing, but I am so scared of it being marked down as malingering of sorts that I can't stop crying because I am so scared I'm going to build up all this courage to finally reach out and get help for once in my life just for it to be brushed off. 



 For context, I am 19 years old and a girl. Im scared that if I bring in this list of symptoms/ what I speculate they could relate too (pointing out the similarities in my own symptoms and what my diagnosed family members experience) I will be told that I'm most likely eluding myself into believing I have these/ only wanting to be diagnosed with something because it 'trended' on social media. Is there anyway I can prevent this?? I have been trying so hard to build up the courage to finally get help but just the very idea of this happening to me is making me reconsider the idea almost completely.

I didn‚Äôt give myself enough credit at first, since the only people to tell me they were proud of me were my parents after I left. It was the first time I think I‚Äôve heard that from them.

Be prepared if you want to continue this might be kind of long 


I guess or sum it up, since 13 things were hard. I didn‚Äôt grow up in a good house and I wasn‚Äôt allowed to be anything but happy. I got into a lot of adult things, went through a lot of stuff no one should have to go through and it‚Äôs probably fucked me up somewhat. 

The big problem is since  I was a kid everyone that ever got close to me didn‚Äôt stay. People I cared for disappeared, no one able to find them. Iv been on call with people who got close to me with their terrible thoughts, pictures of them hurting themself before there never heard from again. Another one is i use to push everyone away even when I didn‚Äôt try. 


I still wasn‚Äôt doing good but i decided to confess my feelings for my friend of 4-5 years and turns out he‚Äôs always felt the same. As of recently I was terrified to scared to tell him how I felt, I wanted to but every time I tried I just started crying and eventually he left. He knows what he wants to do with his life and even though I wanted to do the same and share that life with him he didn‚Äôt believe me and thought I was only saying that to keep him. It‚Äôs true I wanted to spend my life with him and be by his side but I was genuine. In the end we‚Äôre still friends but his feelings have faded. 



In my head if we didn‚Äôt get back I rather die alone then try and find Somone else. I am a person and always had standards of what I wnated in a partner and he was the only person that checked off the boxes of what I wanted in a partner ntm Iv known him for a while and always had feelings for him. But I also feel like shit in general bc I feel like jinx‚Äôs real counterpart. She even says in the show how everyone gets close to her gets hurt. And no matter how hard Iv tried to change things it always end up the same. My head is all over the place of being in pain bc I lost my partner I wanted to spend my life with but also in pain from constantly having others get hurt around me or disappear. Idk why people around me always get hurt but I wish it would stop. I just wanna build a life with somone that makes me happy and be able to love life without the worry of something bad happening but when I finally let my guard down something happens and I have a million thoughts and am not sure what to do.

Hey everyone,

I wanted to share something personal I‚Äôve been struggling with lately and would love some advice. I‚Äôve always been someone who strives to do things perfectly, whether it‚Äôs school, work, or even personal projects. While this might seem like a good thing at first, I‚Äôve noticed it has started to impact my mental health and daily life.

For example, when I start a new task, I spend so much time planning and trying to get everything perfect from the beginning that it ends up delaying progress or even stopping me from finishing things. I constantly feel like what I do isn‚Äôt good enough, and this mindset has led me to put off things I know I should be doing.

The worst part is that it makes me doubt myself constantly, even when I do achieve something. I‚Äôve been trying to let go of this pressure I put on myself, but it‚Äôs tough. I‚Äôm afraid of making mistakes and failing, and I get frustrated when things don‚Äôt turn out exactly how I envisioned them.

Has anyone here struggled with perfectionism? How do you manage it and stop it from holding you back? Any advice on how to accept imperfections and not let them control my life would be really helpful!

hi, I'm the one who need extreme therapy and help in this situation. I'm making this post to just hopefully get it out of my chest and I actually don't even know. I'm just babbling stuff out. WARNING. THE TOPIC IS HEAVY AND SENSITIVE. PLEASE DON'T COME AT ME CALLING ME NAMES, I KNOW WHAT I AM.
this situation involves me(17M) and my boyfriend(16M).

we usually argue like any other couple, its usually the normal amount but more than half a year ago I started to despise him much more easily during arguments. I always pushed it aside thinking I'm just angry. soon it evolved into the mess I am now. I get angry way too easily, more recently I've tried hurting my cat because he was scratching my arm during heat(thankfully I didn't do anything, I think the loud noise startled him though.).

more recently my boyfriend and I had an argument and I wished him and his friends, who were sort of involved in the situation, death and a lot more nasty stuff. I told him I want to kill him, he annoys me, I want to hurt him in my mind but didn't want to act on it. he asked if that was why I changed my university plan of moving out together. (I changed the university I'm aiming for so we won't live together and I won't hurt him at least physically.) 

now I have to come clean. I hate how I act. I don't like how violent I am, I feel ashamed. before anyone says go to therapy, I can't afford it. my parents are breathing down my neck about me being the perfect son and having an equally good mental health. my mom even made a joke saying she can pay me the money instead of giving it to 'some stranger'. I hate this and the fact that I'm not diagnosed with anything makes it harder to just go and buy meds for some help.

I‚Äôm in my early 30s, autistic, and really struggling. Life‚Äôs felt unbearable lately. I lost my mum not too long ago, and since then, everything‚Äôs felt hollow. I‚Äôm dealing with grief, mental health issues, financial stress, and a toxic living environment where I‚Äôve experienced bullying and don‚Äôt feel safe.

Being autistic makes everything even more intense ‚Äî I get overwhelmed easily, routines breaking down throw me off completely, and I often shut down because I can‚Äôt explain what I‚Äôm feeling.

The people I thought were friends have turned out to be fake. Some have undermined me when I needed support the most. My neighbours mostly keep their heads down and ignore what‚Äôs going on. I‚Äôve been left feeling completely alone, like I‚Äôm carrying all of this on my own.

I‚Äôm doing what I can ‚Äî trying to pay off debts, save to move somewhere safer, and rebuild a routine. But most days, I feel completely burnt out and stuck in survival mode. I‚Äôm not living ‚Äî just existing.

Well im 31 now. Since i was 17 ive been in and out of bad depression or anxiety cycles. I spent a good bit of my 20s doing nothing after dropping college. Got hooked on alcahol then benzos. Clean now. But im currently at the worst ive ever been. 

Recently came off effexor to try something better and it unearthed alot of bad ocd and anxiety. Im not exactly sure where im going with this as my anxiety has put me in a box.

 I cant imagine having to commute i cant imagine having to pay bills and be stuck in a job because i havnt been truly stable in a long time. My outlook on life is pretty bleak and i never hold a job. I love my family and have it really good but now that im 31 and the depression is hitting hard. I cant accept things i feel incredibly spoiled because my anxiety drives me nuts.

 Maybe i need to move out and grow as a person maybe that's what is holding me back. I am well aware that i can change into someone i never imagined i just have deceloped ocd harm so i feel very indecisive. I grew up never having to work so i pick and chose jobs. Now im ready to work but the depression keeps me at home. The places my brain goes when its quite are scary and i have changed as a person. I cant imagine living as an adult. But i guess the first year of work will be the hardest.

 Im going to continue to meditate on the b person i want to be. I guess my question is what did it feel like for you to grow up? How do i know i wont be a shitty person because i have to work in a crappy situation. I used to be so posative and would do any job but more i feel so spoiled and entitled. I want to get back to a sense of well being and stop worrying about the future.

I am currently in therapy for ERP and i am just starting Zoloft hoping to knock the anxiety down. I had a plan in the fall and it fell through. I keep asking my self why should i and i feel i need to be homeless to truly understand. 

Just over the last two years i got screwed over in jobs and i realized a lot of my faults. I also started trt but i just feel jealous, entitled, imposter, angry, i scream why, i wish i could change my past. Honestly if i could describe it in one word, hard work doesn't feel good anymore. Ive lost my optimism. I always had a sense of well being.

Don't get me wrong Im not in a bad place at all, i just know i have to get my shit together. I live with mom and dad and pay for groceries and rent and i take care of all the maintenance and housework/lawnwork. Its a big house for just us three. And it benefits them greatly. I was going to go back to school but i just need to start saving money.

I just want to know that i can be an adult, i can be decisive, i can be compassionate again and not be jealous. I don't want circumstances to change me.

A few years ago people from my friend group would accuse me of lying and ignoring or just making huge arguments which lasted like 1 hour and sometimes a bit more. During them I wanted to cry and whenever I saw the long texts pointing out what I did wrong my heart was racing and my hands were shaky. It was more of me explaining everything I have done than arguing. It was also about that I didn't like when somebody was making fun of me. I would constantly apologize and we would close the topic but it always was opened again by the ""leader of the group"". Then I ended the friendship with the group by ""standing up"" for myself. I have to say I did it in the dumbest way possible that I regret till now but atleast it was over. 
Then I was alone in school for a good few but long months. 

Then I got another friendgroup that I'm in untill now and I gladly don't feel like there's a leader, there was a few misunderstandings but they were never too huge and I guess you can call it something easy to brush off. It's not perfect but I guess what friendships are?

But there is another friend group I'm in. I like the people, I feel good around them. But recently I got a long text about me being rude, mean, sarcastic etc. in my texts. It was never in my intention to be like this because I never had a problem with any of them. While I was texting back honestly ""explaining myself"" I thought my heart is going to jump out of my chest. A few moments after that I burst out crying.

It felt just like the situation from years ago. I'm scared it's somehow coming back, something like a tragic fate I can never escape. I don't wan't to be disliked again, become somebody who people laugh at, somebody who is stresed everyday by the thought of going to school.

For a long time I've felt sad, anxious and hopeless. Everything feels really dull and nothing makes me truly happy. I'm not always sad but often indifferent.

I said there isn't much I can do because his parents are too controlling and last time he talked about his problems his parents were mad at us and said that his problems aren't ours. And if I talk with him about his problems, probably his parents will get mad and me and try to stay him away from me. Also I wish he could leave his house and live with me when he'll turn 18 (in 4 years) but my parents doesn't want to and I can understand why (they say that is much responsibility and if something really bad happens we couldn't know what to do or how to help him. But fortunately he can live with his grandmother and I could probablt live by myself in 4 years so there isn't much of a problem in that way).
I also feel like I'm starting developing an emotional dependency towards him and I'm crying at least once per week for his situation and worrying of he does something terrible towards himself.
He sometimes respnd my messages and that is something that bothers me and affects me a little bit but after asking him about that he just said that his social battery drains very quickly amd I velive him but do you think he may be lying?

Although my major is immensely math heavy and I had very little exposure to math in my undergard, yet I opted for it as it's one of the most demanding subjects right now. I overestimated my capabilities and decided to do it anyway. Now 2-3 months have passed since I started this degree, I am in the worst mental state in my life so far. Everyday I attend classes and don't understand anything what the teacher and peers discuss about. I am lagging behind in the most basic concepts and failing to apply anything in advanced stages.

Hello everyone, I feel like I am not thinking logically, so I wanted to ask Reddit for help. By no means do I mean that I have more to deal with than my mom (who is mentally ill), in case you thought I meant that by the title. I just want to know how to best protect my mental health and still support her.
My mom recently has been diagnosed with depression and with health anxiety (sometimes this is directed at my younger brother). She is always worried about herself or my little brother having a serious illness and has started anxiety meds, which haven‚Äôt been working (as she says). I (F21) have been sleeping over at my boyfriends house a couple of days a week for about 3 years. I also study and work part time.
Since her diagnosis she calls me multiple times a day to tell me what types of ,,symptoms‚Äô she/my brother has and I always reassure her that it‚Äôs nothing and explain logically where these symptoms could come from. Most days it‚Äôs three calls, on bad days it‚Äôs 8 calls, sometimes she calls met at work or uni. But when I‚Äòm with my boyfriend she calls without holding back at all. 
When I‚Äòm home it‚Äôs the same as when she calls. Multiple times she asks me the same questions. We barely talk about anything else. Sometimes I get frustrated when she asks me the same questions about some illness she thinks my brother may have. I never get loud or disrespectful, I just don‚Äòt give long responses. This really sets her off and we start fighting, because I‚Äòm the only person she can talk to since she has no friends and our family lives in another country (she isn‚Äôt close with them). She says I should always listen to what she has to say, go with her to the doctor multiple times a week (she has never learned the language in 21 years of living here and wants me to translate). I can‚Äôt always go with her and I honestly don‚Äôt want to, I have to study for exams and that time just gets taken away in waiting rooms‚Ä¶
She hates that I go to my boyfriend‚Äòs house. She wants me to stay home and not sleep over anymore, to calm her down and in case something serious happens. Sometimes when I‚Äòm out with friends she calls just because she wants me to come home.
Are her  needs justified? Should I always answer her calls and stay home? I really want to know what to do, how I can help her and how I can stay sane at the same time‚Ä¶

Hello! This is my first time posting in this thread, long time reader.  
I am seriously working hard on my mental health. Growing up I had a rough childhood, and it never got easier into my adult life. I am now 26 years old, massively in debt, and recovering from a gambling addiction and suicidal thoughts.

My ex-girlfriend of 5 years left me when I hit my lowest point. Only leading to further problems mentally. Since she left me, however, almost a year ago, I have been on a journey of self-improvement. I can truly say things are getting better, however, I am experiencing a new issue that I don't know how to handle or control. I can be in a completely great mood, and then out of nowhere, something small will burden me, and it's like a switch gets flipped in my head, and I lose all control of myself. I don't get angry, instead, I just shut down inside and begin self-destructing / self-deprecating telling myself ill never amount to anything and hating myself. I get into a headspace where I feel like nothing matters at all except for punishing myself. The worst part about it is that I have no control over the things I say and do when I get like this. Sometimes, it's quick; other times, it can last for hours, and I'll snap out of it to realize I just destroyed so many of the things I have been working for.

For example, I've been working on saving money for a car for myself. I have been super diligent about my money for a few months, and this week, my boss said I couldn't keep using the company car for personal things. (I work for a small flooring company, and they have never had a problem with me taking it for the weekends or after work). I became super overwhelmed when he said it, I told the company I had been interviewing with and applying to that I wasn't interested anymore in a rude way, and that they would be way better off without me. I blew everything I had saved (Not at the casino, which I am proud of myself for). I just went on this 12-hour spree of ruining my life further.

Looking back at it, it makes no sense why I would do such stupid things over something so small. I can't help but feel like a toddler throwing a temper tantrum at times, but at a much larger scale.

I need help with this, so please, any feedback is greatly appreciated.",stop self destructing hello first time posting thread long time reader seriously working hard mental health growing rough childhood never got easier adult life 26 years old massively debt recovering gambling addiction suicidal thoughts exgirlfriend 5 years left hit lowest point leading problems mentally since left however almost year ago journey selfimprovement truly say things getting better however experiencing new issue dont know handle control completely great mood nowhere something small burden like switch gets flipped head lose control dont get angry instead shut inside begin selfdestructing selfdeprecating telling ill never amount anything hating get headspace feel like nothing matters except punishing worst part control things say get like sometimes quick times last hours ill snap realize destroyed many things working example ive working saving money car super diligent money months week boss said couldnt keep using company car personal things work small flooring company never problem taking weekends work became super overwhelmed said told company interviewing applying wasnt interested anymore rude way would way better without blew everything saved casino proud went 12hour spree ruining life looking back makes sense would stupid things something small cant help feel like toddler throwing temper tantrum times much larger scale need help please feedback greatly appreciated,1,1,0,Neutral,Moderate,[],[]

I'm selfish i know. I'm so sorry to all the people i've hurt and will hurt. I'm trying to keep it together in front of my family and friends because I don't want to hurt them. I know ive got so much to live for and ill be able to achieve great things. Trust me, I know and I recognise that. I'm not gonna say it's freeing, but I just want closure. I want to stop, not to keep going on.

I'm laughing and smiling around people, i'm happy, i'm making jokes. I want to keep trying. But i can't. I'm obliged to keep living and its selfish to let go. Theres so many people around me who make life worth living and i'm letting all of them down. 

The feeling comes in waves. One moment i'm feeling fine and the next it's like my heart stopped. My body's functioning but my mind's somewhere else. The lump in my throat makes it hard to breathe. My mom asked me what I wanted for breakfast and I couldn't even answer her. 

I told my brother a lot of what was going on (excluding the suicidal parts) and he listened to all of it. I'm so thankful for a brother like him. He doesn't understand cause he's so young. I'm not gonna bother him with my problems. I hope he will have the best life, I love him so much.

Thank you to my parents, who've raised me for so many years. We might've had our differences but deep down I'm grateful to have met them, and will love them till the end of time. Thank you to all my friends, they've shaped me to become who I am today, and I love them all so much. I've had so many happy memories which i'll treasure.

I'm a mosaic of every family and friend I've met, and a part of them will forever be with me. For that I love myself as i'm a reflection of everyone i've loved.

I'm not blaming anyone. I'm so thankful for all the people ive got to know, good or bad. It's no one's fault, not my family, my friends, people around me, people who dislike me, or even God. It's just how life played out and i know im gonna hurt so many people and its incredibly selfish of me to do it. For that i'll never be able to forgive myselt. Believe me, I'm grateful to have lived a good life, and I'm grateful for having had a chance to live. 

This isn't a post for people to stop me in the comments. Please don't feel bad or sad for me, i don't feel sad nor do I blame anyone. It's not the world's fault, there is no fault.

I¬¥m writing to you to understand how you¬¥re dealing with the issue of political division in the world. My situation is that I¬¥ve been going off the mainstream media for quite some time now after I realized certain issues. At the time I was living outside my home country and I loved my new temporary home pretty much. Political situations I couldn¬¥t have cared less about came up and suddenly I found the reality in the country not reflected at all in the media of my home country. I was very confused at the time.... Long story short... After a short stint in my home country, I decided to leave fo another destination. My confusion has vanished and my trust in media is gone. Any media. I don¬¥t believe in 3-letter-media or podcasters or whatsoever. All that is left, is my gutt-feeling...

Here my problem: I live surrounded by people who are living in the world that is long gone for me. And I can¬¥t leave for now. For most people around me the 3-letter-media are still the absolute truth, XYZ is the devil, ZXY is a hero. I don¬¥t think that they are what media calls them. I also have a group of friends which thinks the opposite way. None of these groups is my home. But everything is politicized now.

My feeling is that I can¬¥t talk to anyone anymore with encountering these egregious ideas that demand total devotion and have totally washed away what we called ""tolerance and liberty"" when I was growing up. Everything that was exisiting in a fringe corner and could be talked about with ""see...some people think that way and other people feel that way, but actually... let¬¥s play some music and have a drink..."" is now on the first page of the news and we¬¥re confronted with them and we¬¥re forced to have a position. And often only one position is allowed.

I wish I could consent to all that and just nodd off. But I can¬¥t... I¬¥m feeling overwhelmed. I just want to talk to people about things I see in the world without being shunned. The days where we just discussed different world views mask off seem so far away...

1jlzuqb,2025-03-28T18:00:26,"Mental illness CAN be an excuse, discussion
TL/DR: I think that‚Äôs sometimes a mental illness can be used as an excuse, just like how physical illness can. 

Here‚Äôs the situation: Me and my sister had a conversation last night where she was bringing up an issue she had with something I was doing. It was a healthy convo, but we disagreed heavily and both got overwhelmed, eventually just deciding to leave it for now. But something came up that I thought I‚Äôd bring here to get more opinions.

I have ADHD, along with a couple other mental disorders. I explained to her that sometimes I couldn‚Äôt look at something that I‚Äôm not engaging in (ex. reading something) for more than like 5 minutes because it‚Äôs a lot of work to try and get my brain to focus, and sometimes I don‚Äôt have the energy, and this can happen even when I‚Äôm excited about the thing and want to look at it. She still didn‚Äôt get it and I realized she wouldn‚Äôt so I told her that I was sorry, and I hated it too, but it wasn‚Äôt a choice. I have a literal disconnect in my brain between wanting to do something and doing it, and my attention span will never be normal. I do so much already to try and counteract it.

She got frustrated and told me that she knows that I‚Äôm explaining but it sounds like I‚Äôm using it as an excuse. I responded that I think it is an excuse. I related it to physical health and someone with back problems not being able to do sports for more than 5 minutes sometimes, and that‚Äôs perfectly reasonable that they don‚Äôt strain themselves. It‚Äôs disappointing and you feel bad but it‚Äôs a part of living with an illness. She didn‚Äôt see the connection, but I feel like the point still stands.

My point is: Sometimes a mental disorder/illness has effects that you can‚Äôt control, and when those things happen I think you should be able to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but this is why that happens and I need you to not hold it against me.‚Äù I don‚Äôt think it shucks off all responsibility, you still need to take accountability and try and find a solution to problems your mental illness is causing other people, especially your loved ones. But I also think other people need to be accommodating to things you can‚Äôt control.

So let's say the 10yr marriage was emotionally abusive - separated but he is supposedly doing work to help himself and our marriage which transpires he hasn't actually seen therapist in months - which falls in with the lack of consistency at keeping up pretenses to prove he's changed and willing to make it work. His attitude is we don't argue anymore and handle conflict differently - well we don't live together so I don't feel overwhelmed.

Anyway is it my trauma response and u healed inner child that keeps ""finding issues"" my therapist said it seems like I'm tapping out. But I haven't felt emotionally connected for a long time, ive been trying to work on myself, my faults and I've read that ""we demand from others what we are most unwilling to give ourselves""

""When we complain about someone, we are really complaining about ourselves""

""Complaints are projecting our own negative feelings or short comings onto others instead of taking control and finding solutions""

""Everyone is a reflection of us""

So I'm confused what I'm meant to work on within myself, because my gripes are that he isn't consistently putting in the work to seek professional help or challenge his thinking or resolve his inner child and false beliefs. Those are things I am doing for myself so what lesson am I meant to learn here because how is my complaint about him, something I'm unwilling to give myself, when I am going this to myself

Am I truly missing something here? Because I'm trying to work really hard to stop myself expecting too much or have unreasonable expectations but I cant seem to find where I am gping wrong or what I should be doing differently so I am accountable and show inner reflection in the relationship.

Any advise or perspective would be helpful.

Nearly finished reading the body holds the score, loads of other books my therapist has recommended etc and I just want to feel confident in my knowing and be a better person who I always thought I was empathetic and conscientious of others but I feel I've gotten a tad bit unsympathetic and selfish of late because I'm fed up with everyone's shit but figured I should therefor sort my own shit out if that makes sense instead of complaining about everyone else and blaming as way of not being accountable ",mirror work reflection confusion ive suffered lordy knows much abuse trauma working therapist reading try educate amd find way grow help keep getting confused lets say 10yr marriage emotionally abusive separated supposedly work help marriage transpires hasnt actually seen therapist months falls lack consistency keeping pretenses prove hes changed willing make work attitude dont argue anymore handle conflict differently well dont live together dont feel overwhelmed anyway trauma response u healed inner child keeps finding issues therapist said seems like im tapping havent felt emotionally connected long time ive trying work faults ive read demand others unwilling give complain someone really complaining complaints projecting negative feelings short comings onto others instead taking control finding solutions everyone reflection us im confused im meant work within gripes isnt consistently putting work seek professional help challenge thinking resolve inner child false beliefs things lesson meant learn complaint something im unwilling give going truly missing something im trying work really hard stop expecting much unreasonable expectations cant seem find gping wrong differently accountable show inner reflection relationship advise perspective would helpful nearly finished reading body holds score loads books therapist recommended etc want feel confident knowing better person always thought empathetic conscientious others feel ive gotten tad bit unsympathetic selfish late im fed everyones shit figured therefor sort shit makes sense instead complaining everyone else blaming way accountable,1,0,0,Neutral,Low,[],[]

I feel lonely a lot of the time, most of my friends are online friends who either live far away in my country or are in different time zones completely so seeing them physically is a rare occurrence nowadays.

When I get upset I eat junk food like chocolate to feel some small form of comfort and happiness, Instead of pushing myself to workout or whatever and then the cycle repeats itself. 

I drive 60 miles a day to work and back so my motivation to exercise before and after work is just non existent. I‚Äôll get about 6-7 hours of sleep on weeknights but lie in on the weekend and go to bed late on the weekend which probably throws my sleeping schedule off.

All of this together is just so mentally and physically taxing to the point where I‚Äôm don‚Äôt feel happy or sad I just feel like I exist in the world as a lingering fog.

I‚Äôm not sure where to start, but I‚Äôm out of ideas on what to do. I struggle horribly with a handful of things. Some things are quite obvious but I haven‚Äôt been diagnosed, so I won‚Äôt mention what I believe I should be tested for. I‚Äôm afraid of anything and everything. I‚Äôm afraid to leave the house some days, I rarely go out and I‚Äôm not enjoying my life anymore. I can‚Äôt sleep anywhere except my room or I will have constant panic attacks. I would‚Äôve done inpatient already if that wasn‚Äôt a problem. 

I‚Äôm also terrified of medicine, certain foods, I hold my breath around certain smells, I‚Äôm hyper aware of my heartbeat and breathing at all times, I get scared there‚Äôs something in my food that could possibly make my body feel different. I‚Äôve been avoiding everything and everyone, even my own family. 

I broke down last night and finally told my father most of the things that had been going on because I was afraid there was something in the peanut butter I had eaten earlier yesterday and had been riding a panic attack all day. He said exactly what I didn‚Äôt want to hear, ‚Äúyou sound like a paranoid schizophrenic, like your real father.‚Äù Those are the words Ive been dreading, the reason I haven‚Äôt told anyone anything about my issues. 

I‚Äôm afraid. I‚Äôm afraid I will end up locked up somewhere some day at the rate my health is declining. It‚Äôs torture, every day I wake up with anxiety, this extreme impending sense of doom until I fall asleep again. It gets worse at night. My mind tells me not to even trust myself, ‚Äúwhat if you aren‚Äôt actually feeling whatever you‚Äôre making up? What if you‚Äôre just making yourself crazy?‚Äù 

It‚Äôs caused me to be unable to work. I don‚Äôt trust any of my coworkers and am constantly thinking about what people think about me, the way I talk, walk, what I look like, I‚Äôm afraid to eat/drink the food I put in the shared fridge for lunch break. It‚Äôs exhausting, it‚Äôs so hard managing my mental health and work at the same time. I would break down every night leaving work. 

Obviously, you can‚Äôt get insurance if you can‚Äôt work. I have no idea how to even get it anyway. I‚Äôm turning 21 tomorrow and I‚Äôm terrified about my future. My real father is the reason for my mental health issues I haven‚Äôt even mentioned at all, all of this is just the hardest stuff.

I lost my whole life before the age of 37, which I am now and am still losing my life because of illnesses like endometriosis, ehlers-danlos.
We are trying to do fundraising because I need surgeries and specialized care abroad.
That is also not going well.
So I keep on suffering extremely physically as well.
I am in pain for 20 years.
I have extreme symptoms for 20 years.
I lost the years from birth to 18 due to childhood traumas and the years from 18 till now due to being ill.
We are now trying to get the right treatments but like I said, we need fundraising and that‚Äôs not going very well.
In the meantime, I see that other fundraisers are doing extremely well. Especially if it‚Äôs for kids. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I am glad for them, but when I was a kid, I was totally neglected.
I am forever 17 in my head and still need the ages of 17 till 37 to come, but that‚Äôs gone forever.
I can‚Äôt deal with this.
I am in so much need to experience these ages like other people can.
To choose what you want to do with your life at 18 years old. To choose the education you want, do student jobs and have fun, go out, travel with friends like these cool youth travel  journeys with partying and swimming pool parties and surfing, in the winter snowboarding trips etc.
My biggest passion is dance.
I still want to be a young fresh beautiful cute dancer girl when being on stage.
Now if I would have the miracle of getting better, I only get to experience things as a forty plus woman.
In my head I am 17 and still need those past 20 years first before I can be 40 üò≠üò≠üò≠
I don‚Äôt know for whatever reason I should still stay on this planet.

1jlt7c7,2025-03-28T12:49:29,"Opinion on When to Involve Emergency Services
From my personal experience, many people in distress don‚Äôt actually need immediate intervention - they need to be heard. Often, their suffering is made worse by feeling unheard and misunderstood. A conversation, genuine listening, and patience - without judgment - can do far more than external intervention. When someone calls authorities instead of offering that space, it can feel like a betrayal. While it may prevent immediate harm, it often leads to long-term damage - instilling fear, distrust, and making it even harder for them to open up in the future. Some people stop talking about their struggles, not because they are better, but because they‚Äôve learned that honesty leads to losing control over their own situation.

In my opinion, the best approach is to provide a sense of safety and autonomy. Listen without judgment, respect their wishes, and, if you're genuinely concerned, ask what kind of support they feel comfortable with. Would they consider professional help? Have they had positive or negative experiences with mental health services? Giving them control over their own path is often the most powerful form of support.

While genuine support should always come first, there are rare cases where intervention is necessary. However, it must be handled with extreme caution. Calling emergency services should be a carefully considered decision - never the police, as their involvement often escalates distress rather than providing care. Only call emergency services against their will if there was a prior agreement or if they are unable to comprehend the consequences of their actions - such as believing they must remove their heart to survive. Forcing intervention against their will can make them feel powerless, deepen their distress, and ultimately push them further away from seeking help in the future.

To make this as quick as possible I‚Äôm just gonna summarize important details. 

Struggles with mental health my whole life. Starting users substances at 14. In and out of treatment facilities almost all my teenage years

Took a boxing class one day, at the age of 16, met the boxing coach who was a 28 year old woman. Started off with friendly conversations, turned more deep, and we both related to each other a lot in regards to mental health struggles. One day she put my number I her phone

We started off texting every few days, but they would be long texts. Just talking about life, and stuff. This turned into every day after a while and the texts got longer. I realized I was attracted to her. She invited me to start hanging out at her apartment and going on walks around the park and out to lunch, but it was still just friendly stuff. 

She would buy me a lot of gifts around this time too. I had to go to a 9 month treatment center, and in the weeks before this, I noticed we would make long eye contact after talking. She eventually put her foot on my lap one night. At treatment we talked on the phone a lot and she wrote me a lot of letters. Still just friendly stuff. We naturally distanced after a while but reconnected after I did something stupid and got sent to juvie. She showed up to all my court dates. When I got out we hung out a lot

One njght close to my 18th birthday she told me she was in love and wanted to marry. I was infatuated with her so we started dating and got engaged. On my 18th birthday we had sex. She started wedding planning. She told me she was ‚Äúinfertile‚Äù and enjoyed sex more without a condom. We were deeply in love for the first 4 months, then we started arguing. And this became frequent. She started becoming distant and when I asked why she said it was me and she was acting normal. Gift giving stopped, sex wasn‚Äôt initiated, and she didn‚Äôt make much time for me. I found out she got pregnant. She was very conflicted on what to do about that. She wanted to keep it at first, but eventually chose abortion. This broke us both. I relapsed and went to treatment. 

When I got out I moved into a sober living home, and we were still dating. In January of this year, she found drugs in my room, and left the house. She texted me goodbye and blocked me on everything. Haven‚Äôt heard from her or seen her since. This whole thing has just been so hard to process and I just needed to vent. I am starting to think I got groomed and was just a naive kid. Idk man

I used to be a very lively person, always happy and laughing, and then suddenly I turned into this unhappy woman who always keeps crying.

1jlo8wf,2025-03-28T06:49:15,"Struggling with Body Image, Social Anxiety, and Lack of Support - Looking for Guidance
Hey everyone,

I'm reaching out because I‚Äôm struggling with body image issues, social anxiety, and a lack of support from those around me, and I don't know where to turn for help. I‚Äôve been dealing with these issues for years, and lately, it‚Äôs been getting harder to manage.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been experiencing:

Body Image: I‚Äôve always felt insecure about my body. I have a very slim build, and I‚Äôve been trying to gain muscle, but my genetics (I suspect I might have a condition called Marfan Syndrome) make it really difficult. My chest and overall physique make me feel inferior, and I often feel like people judge me based on my appearance. When I go clothes shopping, I struggle to find things that fit well, and I end up wearing oversized clothes, which makes me feel worse. I feel better when I can build muscle, and I‚Äôve seen progress with my hands, but I still feel like I‚Äôm not enough.

Social Anxiety: I constantly feel like people are judging me when I‚Äôm out in public, especially if they laugh around me. I feel paranoid, like they're laughing at me. I also struggle with talking to people, and when I see myself in the mirror, I feel fine, but the second I take my clothes off, I feel like I look horrible, even from a side angle.

Lack of Support: My parents don't believe me when I tell them it‚Äôs something I was born with, and they blame me for being so slim. Relatives have made nasty comments about my appearance, and this has left me feeling really low. I‚Äôve also tried speaking to therapists in the past, but the high cost and the need to repeat my story every time have made it difficult. Free helplines don‚Äôt work well either, as I end up starting from scratch every time.


I know I need help, but I feel overwhelmed by everything. I‚Äôm trying to work on building my body on my own, but the lack of a proper diet or gym access right now is holding me back. I‚Äôm also concerned about my mental health and how I‚Äôm being affected by these negative thoughts and feelings.

And I was using all of 6th 7th and some of 8th grade until one day I noticed that I was ruining my life. So I started the road to quitting, meanwhile I was never caught using anything whether in school at home or other places. But I slipped up a few times on my way to quitting but I'm now a full year clean. (yay me) and I recently moved states a few months ago and I've been stressed then I had a serious serious family self defense issue that I probably shouldn't get into but back to the suicidal thoughts and the way I think. So I'd say I'm a lot smarter than most people and not in a academically but just pure knowledge wise I was always told I was ten steps ahead and grades ahead of what I should be doing English especially. But I've always been a big picture guy, I don't really know how to explain it i just know how small we are and insignificant we are. Nothing anyone's does today or in our lives will have a significant impact on the future, we are likely going to push ourselves into extinction within a few hundred years we are basically like a nanometer compared to Jupiter just so infinitesimally small that nothing will change the course of history.

Thoughts? -What do you do when you‚Äôre alone with no one to talk to? You talk to yourself. And I‚Äôve been so alone that my own voice became a knife in the silence that surrounded me. It felt foreign and sharp in contrast to the empty space I constantly occupied. So instead of talking to myself, I write online, typing thoughts like confessions into the void in the hopes that someone, anyone, might echo back something other than the pain Im trying to exorcise from myself.

Depression doesn‚Äôt always look like pale skin, dark circles, and messy hair. Sometimes, it looks like a perfectly normal girl sitting  in her living room, doing everything she can to seem fine. I‚Äôll never forget the stranger who came to my apartment one night. It was supposed to be a date, but I canceled in the most honest way I could because I was simply, utterly exhausted from hiding that I was not okay. I hadn‚Äôt been okay for a long time, and I couldn‚Äôt pretend I was anymore . I told him I was struggling with thoughts of suicide and couldn‚Äôt bring myself to leave my apartment.  he asked if he could still come over‚Äîif I would still have him. I remember staring at that message, thinking maybe he hadn‚Äôt actually read mine, or at least not all of it. So I asked again, plainly‚Äîdid you see what I said? Did you see what I said? That I‚Äôm not okay. That I‚Äôm struggling to stay alive today. He hadn‚Äôt. He missed the part where I confessed the weight I‚Äôd been carrying. When he finally read it, I told him that I wouldn‚Äôt hold it against him if he chose not to come. And I had meant it I know people feel pressure in these moments‚Äîthere‚Äôs a sense of panic, of moral responsibility. Most people don‚Äôt want someone to end their life, but they also don‚Äôt know what to say or how to be in the room with that kind of truth. And honestly, I‚Äôm glad some people don‚Äôt understand. Even if it‚Äôs why people like me are often judged or dismissed or met with awkward silence‚Äîit means they haven‚Äôt had to carry this weight. And I wouldn‚Äôt wish it on anyone. This isn‚Äôt romantic. It‚Äôs not poetic. It‚Äôs not  martyrdom , or some glamorous kind of sadness. It‚Äôs a slow rot. It‚Äôs something that gnaws at the foundation of you until your body remains but you‚Äôre no longer inside it. It‚Äôs destructive. And when he said he still wanted to come over, I let him. I didn‚Äôt clean up or change. I stayed in the same clothes I‚Äôd been wearing. When I opened the door, I tried to keep my face neutral, blank not for me, but for him. I didn‚Äôt want to make him uncomfortable. I was numb. My body was tired. My spirit felt worn through. The apartment was dim, too quiet, too still like a tomb. I had moved my life into the living room because the bedroom felt like it was swallowing me whole. There was no clutter, just a hollowed-out kind of order‚Äîessentials and nothing more. When he looked at me, the first thing he said was, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt look like someone struggling with wanting to die.‚Äù And something in me flinched. I didn‚Äôt know what I had expected, but it wasn‚Äôt that. For a second I wondered, Is that what people think? When they see me? When they see anyone? What does someone look like when they‚Äôre collapsing inside? I looked him in the eye and asked, ‚ÄúIs there some way you have to look to feel that way?‚Äù Depression doesn‚Äôt wear a uniform. It doesn‚Äôt always show up in ways you can see. Sometimes it looks like chaos. Sometimes it looks like disintegration. And sometimes it looks just like i did that night standing blank-faced at the door, breathing through dying on the inside while trying not to make it weird for the guy standing on the welcome mat.
At the lowest points of my depression, it‚Äôs wild to me that it was when  I received the most compliments on my appearance. I was the thinnest I had ever been, and that includes the times when I was deep in active eating disorders and drug abuse. I went from 210 pounds down to 120 in four months. I‚Äôd look at myself in the mirror and i could no longer  recognize the hollowed-out person looking back at me.  My body matched what i felt like inside, like I was shrinking out of my life. People smiled at me like wasting away was an accomplishment I was now achieving . No one saw the  screaming that the change really was . they just saw someone who had been overweight becoming skinny. And that was ‚Äúa good thing.‚Äù I was praised for silently drowning. 

I understand how helpless it feels to care about someone who‚Äôs suicidal. You want to help. You want to take their pain away. But you can‚Äôt. I know that powerlessness. But I also know what it‚Äôs like to be on the other side, to be silently pleading for someone to see me. To not tell me my feelings are wrong. To not tell me I‚Äôm overreacting. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel loved,‚Äù and people have rushed to say, ‚ÄúBut you are loved,‚Äù ‚ÄúThere are people who love you,‚Äù as if my suffering was something I choose to feel As if I were being dramatic. Ungrateful. Blind to what‚Äôs right in front of me.

I‚Äôve stood in both places. And I still can‚Äôt tell you definitively what the right way to be is. But what  I can say is: sometimes the right thing isn‚Äôt a thing at all. It‚Äôs simply presence. just‚Ä¶ someone actively being there. 

I get that many people don‚Äôt know how to sit with me in my pain. But God‚Ä¶ I wonder do they ever step outside their own skin even for a moment, to wonder what it‚Äôs like for me to live in it? I can‚Äôt escape it. I can‚Äôt soothe it. It doesn‚Äôt stay stuffed away. It‚Äôs always there, persistent, aching, taking the coloring from everything. No one can see it. And that‚Äôs its own kind of pain. Because I feel it‚Ä¶ but their criticisms of how I react to what they think just doesn‚Äôt exist makes me question if I‚Äôm even really feeling it at all. Until I begin to gaslight myself
I can‚Äôt describe to you the tragedy of experiencing so much humanity within myself, and yet being convinced I‚Äôm fabricating it. Like it‚Äôs if I‚Äôm stabbing myself and crying for help, but everyone‚Äôs too busy pointing out that the knife is in my hand to notice that I‚Äôm bleeding out.

I know everyone has something going on that no one else knows about. We‚Äôre all stumbling through this life for the first time. And none of us really knows what we‚Äôre doing here. Sometimes, that thought comforts me. It softens the sting when people let me down. Other times, it makes me feel completely bleak and nihilistic. Because I know, no one is coming to save me. And no matter how hard I try, I can‚Äôt seem to save myself.

I don‚Äôt blame anyone.

1jlqedg,2025-03-28T09:31:38,"Is my need to be perfect what is causing so much pain?
I (M 19) have essentially been held to the highest standard my entire life. My family has always said that the most important thing is grades and academics, to the point of keeping me out of sports and extracurricular activity so I could focus on my studies. I was always harshly punished for falling short of grades (anything below a 90% was considered failure in my household) and was always told that I would be great. This has been a constant in my life as long as I could remember, this idea that I would one day be someone who goes down in history. I kid you not I once told my parents I was only 18 and I was doing pretty good compared to most and was told ‚ÄúAlexander was 18 when he was toppling nations‚Äù (which isn‚Äôt true by the way) ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have an excuse‚Äù This idea was reinforced when I got into the gifted program at my school at a young age where, I was never directly told, but it was heavily implied that I was ‚Äúgoing places‚Äù and I was destined for more than my classmates. 
This was all fine and dandy until I got to college, where, egged on my parents because of the future career benefits, I decided to join Greek life, something that I was always told would help my to achieve my dreams. This posed a couple of issues because, 1, I was a nerd who had never been allowed to play sports and didn‚Äôt have any social skills, and 2, I had learned that the only way to be good enough was by being the best. The fraternity i joined is well regarded and fairly large, but not the best on my campus, something that makes me feel awful regularly. I quickly began to realize that I wasn‚Äôt the smartest anymore, not only this but the people around me were better looking and more confident than I could ever be. This was around the time that, for the first time in my life, in my freshman year of college, I got a C in a class, I need to emphasize how devastating this was for me, at this point I had never studied, didn‚Äôt pay attention and had been thought that i wouldn‚Äôt have to because I was me. My parents immediately cut my financial support, leading to the need for me to get a full time job on top of everything.
My life feels like it‚Äôs falling apart, and I don‚Äôt know why. Whenever I confide in someone about my deep insecurities, they are often surprised because from the outside, I‚Äôm doing quite well, I have decent grades, I‚Äôm fairly attractive (though I can‚Äôt see it), I‚Äôve made great strides in social development, and everyone seems to love me. But for some reason I berate myself for being constantly inadequate, because I can‚Äôt measure up to everyone around me, I‚Äôm not the best at anything, I‚Äôm average and it‚Äôs the closest feeling to physical pain I can explain.

Sorry if this text is clunky and hard to undsrstand, im really upset while typing this

Already at the age of 4 I was hit by both my parents. Long story short they ""were"" stupid and is ""trying"" to make thinks better. The last time my dad hardcore assaulted me was when I was 12-13.

I've was suicidal from 10 to a while ago. I stopped being suicidal because in a few months I have a chance to move out to my grandparents to study in university. I want to be able to make to be successful despite of my upbringing and be able to insult them before I'm able to completely cut ties with them. My mom warned and manipulated me to now tell anyone how they treated me. The reasons why I still haven't reported them is because they put up with my abnormal sleeping habits and lets me be, and I have alot of chronic dieses but my dad disturbs me if I dont respect his authority or whatever that guy does in need for validation.

He just barged into my room and screamed at me because I didn't wanna talk to him and hung up the phone abruptly. I'm not upset that he was yelling at me but because I have to put up with this until next semester. He yelled I wasn't raised well (insult in my home language) as if that was someone else's job, I yelled at him he didn't raise me at all and just hit me at the age of 4.

I said at that age I don't know any better and he replied ""at that age you know lots"" like what???
I'm pretty sure I developed autism because of how my parents raised me. He got mad because ""that was in the past"" and ""i should stop mentioning it"", he's a pig for trying to block out his past. He's claimed in the past that he wants to make us work but I just absolutely resent him and cannot forget that he did.

1jly3y7,2025-03-28T16:45:19,"I'm really not okay.

(TW! Mentions of self harm and sexual assault) 

Let me just start by saying I have been assaulted 4+ times in my life and in the back of my mind there's always a thought saying ""it has to be your fault at this point, NOBODY gets assaulted THAT many times"" and it hurts. My most recent one ended with me having a miscarriage to a r@pe baby. From my main assaulter, we'll call this person Neptune. (Neptune is not their real name) I was in love with Neptune for so long and from what they told me, they were in love with me too. The first assault with them started in seventh grade, they were a sophomore in high school. 

I wont give many details on the assault because it's a well known story of that person and people I know might find this post. But it happened at a party, and after I was traumatized to say the least. This person I had loved for so long had completely violated me. I still talked to them for a while after that. It was really hard to break away from them because of the trauma bond that had formed after that incident. But months later I finally did, after I had successfully blocked them I didn't talk to them for months.More than a year, but we went to the same school now, I was a freshman and she was a senior. I knew we would eventually cross paths and I was fully prepared to defend myself from her if she tried anything. But I grew weak. My friends and I would go to a local library after school every day and Neptune also went there. 

I tried to ignore her presence at first but we kept staring at each other. And I remember one day my friend waved to Neptune, they knew what had transpired a year ago but they had asked for permission to interact with Neptune because they liked her outfit. I was okay with it but I didn't know this would cause Neptune to come back into my life. This friend of mine let's call him Agreste. He wanted Neptune's number and after a lot of asking eventually I caved and gave it to him. This then led to me thinking, ""maybe Neptune's changed! It's been so long!"" and I spent ages trying to come up with a reason to text them, which I eventually did (how dumb of me I know) and for a while, I mean a really long while, things were great! I really thought they had changed... But Neptune did not change. 

During a day in which we were both heading to the school because of a mandatory performance (both of us were in Choir) we were talking and she texted me saying if I see her going somewhere alone I should follow her so we could talk. I payed no mind to it at first but when it came the time during the show where I saw her going up the school stairs alone and she motioned for me to follow her, I knew I had to make a choice. I mad the wrong choice and I regret it to this day. The things she did to me in that school bathroom were horrible and vile. I hate myself and my body after that event. I ended up pregnant and miscarried after. She didn't care. But because of that pregnancy I met someone amazing. 

My current partner, we'll call him Luca. He provided me with a plan b pill a couple days after the incident. (Obviously it didn't work but I felt so safe and seen after that) That was my first encounter with him. From that day on, I was attached. And we started dating later that month. I realize now that we never got to really know each other. We never had deep conversations or experiences with each other. Since Neptune I haven't been able to heal because I instantly fell in love and continued living life. And for a while it really did help! I was even encouraged to report the assault and now I'm going through the process of prosecution, but the truth is I'm not okay. 

I haven't been to school in weeks. My grades are shit. My boyfriend feels unloved. I feel like shit. My main reason for coming on here is because of my mental health. Neptune has completely broken me. She has used me for her own pleasure and manipulated me because I am naive and young. It hurts. I am broken. I can't even speak and this reason alone is what's tearing apart my relationship. I can't handle questions anymore. I am so hypersensitive and I don't know why this is all crashing down on me so suddenly. Every time my partner asks me a question I respond with ""I don't know."" And I really don't know. I have become so indecisive and confused I don't know anything. 

If Im asked a lot of questions that aren't yes or no then I start clawing at my legs, subconsciously scratching at my skin because it drives me crazy hearing questions, all I can say is I don't know and then when he doesn't want to hear I don't know I just start sobbing. And hurting myself. Today I started hitting my phone against my bed frame. I had a burst of outrage. And I feel so numb. I feel like I'm nothing anymore. All I can PHYSICALLY say is ""I don't know."" That's all I know how to say. I feel like I need to learn how to talk again. I don't know what's wrong with me. My response to this trauma is breaking me when I'm already broken. It's not just hurting me, it's hurting my relationship. I need help and I am not okay. I can't ask to go to a mental hospital because I'm scared. I can't ask for help and I don't know what to do.. I don't know anything anymore. 

To clarify something really quickly; My assaulter is transfem, she was born a male but transitioned to a female. She still has her pee pee stick though which is how I ended up pregnant. 

I am just lost with myself and I have no idea what to do. I can't eat. I can't sleep. I can't get up and shower or even brush my teeth. I just want to be happy again. I want to be happy with him again..

1jli4sp,2025-03-28T01:15:58,"I really struggle with caring about other people's lives and it's always a problem.
I'm a m27, autistic (only mentioning because it may be relevant).

I really struggle to care about other people's interests and passions, so I can come off aloof or uncaring. Sometimes it's easier to lie and feign interest to smooth over a conversation but that doesn't seem like a great long term strategy.

When people panic or cry around me I have to suppress the feeling of annoyance that they can't just pull themselves together. It makes it really hard to maintain relationships, both romantic and otherwise. When people need a shoulder to cry on i can be spikey.

It's come to a head today when my gf was crying after I used the wrong tone. I apologised if I sounded frustrated, and said it was me and not her and that I probably needed some time on my own after work. When she started to explain how she felt I could feel the battle start within myself to pay attention. When she started to cry I could feel myself getting annoyed, although I try to not let any of this show.

I love my gf, I just don't give a toss about her friends or whatever. I'm glad that she has friends. They're super important to her. So is her work which is nice. She has a lot of great qualities. I just want to know she is okay without all the excess irrelevant details.

I know this perspective isn't normal. My mum has told me as much. I don't know what to do however. It's nothing personal against my friends, family or gf - far from it. It's that I don't care about what they think or do. As long as they are happy.

Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated as I feel very alone with this view.

1jljevy,2025-03-28T02:18:50,"My psychiatrist is threading to ‚Äúexpose‚Äù me to my parents
Hey guys i‚Äôm in a bit of a situation and I want to know how to navigate this. Background info i‚Äôm 20f and currently i‚Äôve been withdrawn from school. Around a month ago i tried taking my life. I was withdrawn from school but i wasn‚Äôt made aware of it until 3 weeks in and we already found a place for me to stay. Basically the issue is i‚Äôm not in school but i‚Äôm living in an apartment paid by my parents for me to be close to school. Now me not being enrolled is on me, i had a horrible incident that i won‚Äôt get into details but long story short, horrible experience in my first year (witnessing sewer slide, attempted murder, abuse etc.) all on my own it caused me to not perform well in my classes and i was incredibly mentally i‚Äôll - i‚Äôm not making that an excuse for my faliures but just the reason and i take full accountability of it. ( I can always clarify if you guhs have questions). This issue is, i cannot tell my parents, that‚Äôs literally a non-negotiable i‚Äôve tried and it never ends well. My parents are indian immigrants and they‚Äôve worked their butts off for me, please know i feel guilty about it all the time, i appreciate their help so much but they also are not the type to understand mental health and the second they get angry they don‚Äôt care. (ex. mom blamed brothers depression on me, told me dad once i was suicidal when i was younger and. he comforted me for him to then deny that ever happening and that i have no reason to feel that way and it‚Äôs my fault). What i‚Äôm trying to say is I can‚Äôt tell them that i have severe depression, anxiety and ptsd that resulted in my failing because to them that wouldn‚Äôt be an excuse. You guys might try to convince me and maybe this is where i‚Äôm being dense but i just know my parents and it wouldn‚Äôt work. They are not open minded at all, and to a getter their anger is justified becuase i‚Äôve wasted all their hard earned money even though yes it was out of my control i still could‚Äôve done something, i shouldn‚Äôt have been so weak. Onto why I‚Äôm making this post, when i tried, i was found by my mom and taken to the hospital. There they kept me overnight and i explained this exact situation to my psychiatrist and nurses. However when i had my meeting with my psychiatrist he told me he‚Äôs going to tell my parents there and then, i managed to convince him not to but he followed up with saying that I need to meet him in a month (currently now in like a week or so-ish) and if i haven‚Äôt told them, he‚Äôs going to send an anonymous message to my mom saying i failed uni. Now here‚Äôs the issue, i absolutely understand that in his pov this is the safest route for me but i know my family will be ruined with this info and my parents will lose it. I‚Äôve reflected and i know that this isn‚Äôt something i want to die over so i‚Äôll relay that info to my psychiatrist but i also somehow need to explain that after he threatened me with telling me parents, i tried this month to hint at my situation and they‚Äôve completely shut it down. They act like what happened didn‚Äôt ever happen. My mom has blamed me and made it about herself, just very typical i don‚Äôt believe in mental health actions. But i wanted to know, I also understand there is pt confidentiality systems set in place and him threatening only just increased my anxiety. The whole time we spoke he only continued to shame me and my feelings and mitigate them. I understand having a blunt and real approach is sometimes necessary for pts but he was completely rude and dismissive. I‚Äôm really nervous that when i go back he‚Äôs going to ignore what i say and put me into a bigger problem, i feel very lost i don‚Äôt know where to post this or where to go. If anyone has advice i‚Äôll greatly appreciate it. I know it might seem confusing and i apologize but i will do my best to clarify anything and if you guys know where else i could post this for help too.

1jlia5t,2025-03-28T01:23:10,"I‚Äôm so confused
Almost 10 years ago I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. 

When I was a kid my school said I had ADHD. But no medical professional confirmed.

About 7 years ago I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. 

And just recently i was diagnosed with PTSD.

Add to that, that I was always over sensitive to noises and now get mad if I feel ‚Äòoverwhelmed‚Äô by music, or something in the background like the lights buzzing‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôm just kinda lost. I have all these labels being thrown at me and I don‚Äôt know if any or all and more are right. 

I am a female, so I hear lots about woken not getting diagnosed properly when younger? 

It‚Äôs gotten particularly overwhelming for me as I have very low energy and focus issues. I like to listen to YouTube videos or audio books, to help me zone out and focus, but then I hit a certain point where even that overwhelms me and I want to cry. 

I even get anxiety attacks about watching a new episode of a show I‚Äôm going through, because I don‚Äôt know what to expect. I only want to watch stuff I‚Äôve already seen if I feel like that. 

It really does make me feel super messed up and like all these hopelessness and helplessness I feel. Add to it I lost my job and am physically disabled and I just feel like a burden.

It is paralyzing. I just don‚Äôt feel like I have it in me to do much of anything, and if I ‚Äòpush through‚Äô I feel completely spent. Like I got nothing left and need to sleep. Today I wasn‚Äôt even up to pouring a bowl of cereal. It literally felt like too much work. 

I guess I wanted to post this to see if anyone relates? (Which a part of me hopes you don‚Äôt because I wouldn‚Äôt wish this on anyone), but also so I don‚Äôt feel insane. Battling this invisible enemy no one else sees, you know? 

Sorry for the length, I‚Äôd do a TLDR, but wouldn‚Äôt know how to summarize it.

Thanks to those who read this and I hope I followed the rules. Sorry if I didn‚Äôt.

Thanks

1jlnj1n,2025-03-28T06:02:16,"[Vent] About being employed and life in general
I'm male-presenting, 23, and live at home. My home life is terrible; just cut and dry terrible, and I despise most of my family for either being racist, homophobic, stupid, entitled, narcissistic- or for in general just having ruined each others lives. I *was* employed basically as soon as I came out of college, and due to my mental health I really struggled to keep that job; sleeping-in past the start of my shift, not being able to force the happy-go-lucky energy needed for it- and though these things weren't a good look, the owner was thankfully pretty lenient about it all, as I'd been training there for, like, 15 years before working there. For context, my first job was as a Kickboxing Instructor; I was grandfathered into the role because taking a job there was part of the training once you hit 3rd Dan.

But for reasons I can't explain, and can only blame myself for (when realistically I know there were a thousand other issues with that place before I got the position I did), once I was a full time instructor- attendance started dropping and eventually they couldn't afford to pay me a wage anymore. That, and the building manager doubled the cost of their unit. I stopped going after that, because it just felt awkward- and after having trained there for so many years I was just really tired of it all.

That, and the attitude they gave me surrounding the disability they also technically gave me, really put me off of them as people. During a day of training I was flipped onto the mats and trapped my sciatic nerve in my back muscles, crushing it. Went to physio and they were able to get my muscles to release it, but it's been permanently crippled. I now have pain in my back, and legs, and sometimes everywhere else- which I will have for the rest of my life- and performing any form of manual labour makes it worse.

They refused to let me take a walking stick with me onto the mats to teach with, despite me being sensible with it and never using or holding it inappropriately. I needed and still need it to support my legs whenever my pain is bad, which again is caused by great amounts of physical activity. They somehow thought that I would be able to teach better if I didn't have it? As if removing it from my person would magically make me able to still teach to the level I used to teach at, before I fucked up my body? After it'd happened, I'd been trying to adapt my teaching style to be less active, and more observant and guiding, but that wasn't *their* style apparently.

Anyway, so guess whose second job was legitimately purely manual labour! I worked in a warehouse as a picker and packer, where I was forced to load and unload heavy boxes of random shit day in and day out for two months- before I nearly walked in front of a fork lift because the days had started to blend together so badly, I felt as if I had never actually left the warehouse at the end of the day. That, and I was yelled at about not being able to move as fast as everyone else on the hot glue assembly line, after having gotten said hot glue on my fucking hand, while my muscles were seizing from the nerve pain. This, by a manager who I had told three times by that point, that I was disabled- and needed to be put on the slower tasks if they wanted things to go smoothly. I despise people with a passion; having to interact with other people that aren't a part of my immediate friend group is tiring, unfulfilling, grating and downright anxiety-induced agony. It all just feels so fake.

It was ultimately the bleach truck that made me leave that position though. One of the jobs is to just unload unventilated lorries containing mountains of bleach products. They give you a P90 mask and goggles, and neither are enough.

You might wonder why *that* was my next place of employment though, considering I'd been to both college and University! Well, that was because I got my degree in Film and Television Production. Because I'm a fucking idiot. I'd assumed I was going to be with the Kickboxing Academy forever, and despite my disagreement with how things were run, as well as my overall mental health- it was the one job I've had so far that I could tolerate. It was also a 3 minute walk from my house, so if I overslept I could sprint there and be on time for my shift.

I was not with them forever, however. I'd chosen to do the stupid thing of getting a degree in one of my passions, instead of something that would actually make me money- because I'd hoped that I'd never have to *use* my degree. It is worth noting here however, that I wasn't even necessarily passionate about Film and TV Production either- it was just one of two choices put before me when going to college that elicited any form of reaction out of my soul, that had remained unimpressed, uncaring and acted ignorant to every other choice put before it as an option.

The last wall I have in my defense against swallowing pills or walking out into traffic, is that I have never turned my passion into my job. There is one- *one-* job that I *know* I would be happy, and capable, of doing. If I had to wake up every morning and my job was *video editor* for *anyone* other than myself, I'd kill myself. I feel the need to curl my whole body around this little corner of enjoyment I have managed to somehow find, and if the rest of the outside world ever touches it the agony I would feel and the desolate emptiness that would carve out the place where my heart should be, would disqualify me from ever feeling a spark of passion again. 

Since leaving the warehouse, I have applied for one-hundred and twenty-two jobs, ranging from data entry, to sports coach, to cctv operator- to all other mad, cockamamie positions that I couldn't give less shits about. Of those one-hundred and twenty-two positions, I have had an interview with two. Just two. And one of the companies told me to show up, after they knew it was ¬£500 for me to travel there for the weekend to work and then go home, only to ghost me and force me to find out from the person they'd hired, that someone else got the job.

The other was a Psychic Hotline, that earns me less in a month when you do the math, than I get on Universal Credit.

The bastards that have the *audacity* to tell me I'm not trying hard enough! To accuse me of scheming and plotting to stay on Universal Credit, instead of getting a fucking job- when they can see how many fucking jobs I've applied for- because they require you to document every fucking job that you do! My work coach told me to my face that she thought there was something suspicious about me being on Universal Credit for so long because I'm so well educated- and had the audacity to claim I wasn't looking for positions hard enough!

You know what she listed as evidence? That fact that I hadn't applied for SENIOR fucking positions, using my degree that is both UNDER-QUALIFIED for the position- and that I HAVEN'T USED TO WORK IN THE INDUSTRY EVER-!

How fucking stupid do you have to be; how fucking deplorable, and fitly and rotten do you have to be-?!

The anger I feel when typing all of this out burns so fucking hot in my chest; I feel like I could scream for the rest of my life; until my throat was ripped, and raw- and I still would not be able to give the rage and hatred and bile enough of a voice.

They don't even pay you enough to live off of. Why the fuck would I want to stay on ¬£300 a month, when that barely covers fucking food unless you're tactical, and scrimp, and save every last fucking penny.

Yes, work coach, there *is* something I'm not telling you. It's that every fucking job I have ever worked; freelance or contract, makes me want to kill myself. The idea, the reality, of waking up every morning in the cold; tired, to march to an office, or drive to a warehouse- to spend 8, 9, 10 hours every day of my life, for the rest of my life- slaving away on useless, mind-numbing, unimportant tasks- makes me want to kill myself. I was able to last *two months* before my mind melted and I nearly fucking committed; after so many fucking years of just hoping and praying something would finally kill me, or I would have the fucking guts to kill myself, all it took was *two months* as a wage-slave for my brain to decide it was time!

The thought *alone* makes me so fucking sick that I don't want to live, the reality I just *can't handle*. I haven't self-harmed in years now, and I still don't feel the urge. Instead I feel like a scared, trapped rat pressed against the corner of my enclosure; my heart beating a million miles a second as I wait for an invisible predator to gore me.

We get *so little* time on this Earth to just *live,* and you're telling me I have to spend *two-thirds* of it *earning my right to stay alive?!* FUCK THAT-! There's not enough wonders in this WORLD let alone this UNIVERSE to warrant that kind of deal. I have *seen* what this fucking world has to offer, and I am not impressed. You have taken the actual, legitimate miracle that is life, and twisted it into something *not worth experiencing*. I've seen everything I wanna see. I want off this fucking ride already.

I live in *filth* surrounded by *filth*, where I am forced to reckon with the fact that I very soon will be forced to stay with whatever job I next get, or else my fucking family won't be able to afford to live. That's not fucking fair!

For context, my partner is moving over to the UK by the end of the year, and because the UK is a shit-hole, we'll both need to work in order to afford rent. I've been living at home since I became unemployed; my mum being good for legitimately this one thing and nothing else- which is a whole other can of worms that I want to choke me to death. But soon, I will need to get a job- but I know I can't *handle* getting a job, and it feels like I can *see the guillotine dangling above my neck!*

I just want to create; I just want to exist; I just want to be able to eat, and sleep and be warm, and create- and that's it! Why the fuck do I have to *work* to earn my right to be *alive.*

Also, ha! 'I just need to get a job', as if I haven't taken the first fucking thing I've been able too every god-damn-time it's arrived. You wanna know why the only two places I've worked after the Dojo were at a warehouse, and a psychic hotline? Because they're the only fucking places that said YES!

There is something so fundamentally *wrong* with me and I don't know what it is; I sleep and eat at my desk in my chair; I live surrounded by trashbags because somehow the bins are *always* full- and my mother and brother never actually clean the fucking house (I always clean my area, I just don't take the bags out sometimes for a few weeks); I fantasize constantly about such *fucked up things* that I don't even want to mention because they're that bad; I've just been desensitized to them; I go through trackable phases where I just *can't sleep* no matter how tired I get and it completely fucks up my ability to retain time; the only friends I have live in another country and I might not get to live with them for *five more years*\-!

My ability to spell and read has also been significantly degrading too for the past several years. Sometimes, I'll be typing and I'll just spell a completely different word? Or press the key to a completely different letter- or spell basic fucking words wrong and not know how to spell them. That seems... less important compared to everything else, but it's something that's been upsetting me.

I feel like the few friends I do have are constantly one bad interaction away from leaving me, even when I know for certain they never will- to the point where it sends me into fits of manic depression whenever one of them doesn't respond to a message I send them- which just makes me feel worse because- why the fuck am I like this?

The point of this post was supposed to be me complaining about not being able to tolerate being employed, but it kind of devolved towards the end so I'm probably just going to mark this as a vent. 

I am being serious though when I ask what's wrong with me. If you're, like, a medical professional or something- I ask you to try and point me in the direction of *anything* that would explain why I'm like this because I just want to know. That's it at the end of the day. If I can put a name to what is wrong with me, I think it'd make me feel more secure in knowing I'm not just a pathetic, idiotic loser who can't handle life.

1jl1ue9,2025-03-27T12:37:37,"I feel like a burden when i want to open up to people
Currently 17 (year 12), when i was young (grade 7-10) i had mad anxiety and depression and i was stressed about school and everything going on. I opened up to my mum about it (first time telling anyone i was struggling) and she was fine in the moment like i felt relieved and it was great. But about a week or so later she saw me not studying or something and said something along the lines of ‚Äúdont come crying to me when‚Ä¶ (idk)‚Äù but what stuck was her saying dont come crying to me after my most vulnerable moment and that lowkey fucked me up a bit because i was at the lowest time in my life when i talked to her, and she used it against me. 

I think this might be where my problems with expressing emotion stems from because i always have this fear if i ever want to talk to someone telling me that my problems are invalid, or that im troubling them with my emotions, or that they might use it against me (these 3 are the main ones that come to mind) 

Ive also been put under a lot of pressure from my parents and i constantly feel like im not good enough.

Hello all, 

I wanted some advice on how to deal with a difficult situation at work. I have a younger colleague whom I'm currently struggling to work with. We're both engineers but I'm more on the project management side and she's a developer. I noticed whenever our conversations get technical and I ask her some questions in areas that are not clear for me, for example : ""hey, I am not sure I understood what you meant here in the document, what does x and y mean?"" 
She responds always in a very defensive, confrontational and condescending tone.

This in turn makes me feel very anxious, scared, my heart beats very fast my hands shake and I'm unable to think. I just want to cry in that moment out of fear. 
I want to make her aware of this but I'm concerned she'll gaslight me and make me the problem and make my life more difficult.

The issue is she and I have been talking to eachother about the struggles in the company and she complains about the company everyday to me and she's resigning in 6 months. But it's exhausting her constant complaining. 
I'm afraid to open up to her because she might also say I don't have evidence of this behavior or she might spread rumors about me to her support coworkers and might hurt my job. She cannot be trusted as she's crazy.

Good Morning, 

I guess I am here just looking for support from others that struggle. I have been OCD since I was in 8th grade. I have also had anxiety most of my life. I have had two really rough bouts of depression, one when my son was born and the one I am in now. Just to make a long story short, it all started about 2.5 years ago when I switched job. I was a principal at a middle school and I decided to move to my districts alternative school. I knew it was bad, but I had confidence that I could change it. When I got there it was really rough. I immediately did not like it but I was stuck. While I was there my first year my sister in law took her own life and then a close friend of mine did the same. At the end of the year my son went off to college and I was not prepared for that either. I started to really get down. I have been getting help since it all started. I ended up stepping down from the principal job back to an assistant principal which I did not want to do, but I didn't have a choice. When I have experienced depression it would come and go, now it seems like its here to stay and I get so exhausted dealing with it. I know tons of people deal with it, but it just feels like Im alone. I talk to my wife and mom and I feel like it is wearing them down. I just do not want to deal with this forever. I am on medicine and doing all I know to work to get better. I just feel stuck in this cycle of ups and downs. Primarily downs. Any suggestions or encouragement is welcome.

TW: Depression/ Suicidal Ideation

I don‚Äôt know how to start this, so I‚Äôll cut to the chase. I‚Äôve been struggling with major depression for over 5 years. I feel little identity within myself, and I find that I struggle to make any decisions regarding my own happiness.

I only do things when other people need me to do them. I feel no drive to do anything out of my own volition because, simply put, I don‚Äôt know what I want. I used to love drawing, anime, singing, listening to music, hanging out with animals, etc. But now, every time I look at those things, I feel no more interest in them. 

I‚Äôve been struggling with this on and off for over five years, and almost any direct call to my family asking for help has been met with distain. While some family members were initially supportive, later becoming burnt out and unresponsive (which I think is fair, because I would probably feel the same way) others like my dad and uncle claim that I am either ‚Äúdoing it for attention‚Äù or that the depression in question no longer exists. My father even went as far to call my antidepressant ‚Äúpoison‚Äù. The thing that hurts the most has been hearing from my closest friends, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but I don‚Äôt know how to help‚Äù.

I feel absolutely at a loss for what to do. I feel like I‚Äôve done what I‚Äôm supposed to. I‚Äôve talked to my family and friends about it, I‚Äôve sought treatment, and I‚Äôve tried about four different medications to help alleviate symptoms. I was even hospitalized as a result of this suicidal ideation. 

Please, even if it‚Äôs just little things, what helps you get by? How do you feel motivation? Why is it even worth getting out of bed? I figure that if I just start off with the little things, maybe I can pick myself up.

Hi , I‚Äôm a black 26 YO woman. 

Years of trauma , young adolescent homelessness , worked myself through college and dx with MDD & anxiety at some point , then Bipolar, and now PDD x Borderline . 

I never really got a break in life to care for my mental health properly. Was always in survival mode but did what I could building a tool kit to keep my mental above water just enough to get through the next crisis. 

Life started to calm and get a little more stable (housing &started work) but even with going to therapy twice a week for 2 hours each session I still struggled tremendously. Eventually my therapist talked me into going inpatient, taking leave from work and now I‚Äôm doing intensive outpatient M-F 4 hours per day which is a lot of emotional labor but has been helpful enough to get me out of this spiraling despair I was in. 

I‚Äôm due to go back to work in May but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be ready even with accommodations at work and concurrent intensive treatment. I think I need to work on my mental health and address my trauma without worrying about work. I can‚Äôt do both. And I think I‚Äôll need way more than just a few weeks. Maybe years 

The issue is: 

I support myself . There‚Äôs no family or friends to fall back on financially (not even emotionally really either).

Has anyone ever taken years long break from work to tend to their mental health? What resources might be available to me for finances , housing , meals? I know about the basic government stuff . disability , SNAP, etc . But looking for your not basic answers here. I‚Äôm at a loss.

I‚Äôm losing everyone, and it‚Äôs all my fault. I couldn‚Äôt keep them around, I couldn‚Äôt keep her around. My dear Eme, she was too good for me, I never treated her as she deserved. She loved me so dearly and I rejected her glances, her beautiful smiles and her kind looks. Her love that overwhelmed my heart and my mind. How far I have fallen, I never had confidence. I was 17 5‚Äô8 and I weighed 217lbs, I had to change to survive, I was on the verge of giving up and I lacked any confidence, I still do. I grew up sheltered, my mom could never afford to take us out but she tried her best, she always tried to take us out. I grew up in a home in the Florida suburbs where everything is far and we couldn‚Äôt really do much, my parents got the house after the market crash and my dad was jumping job to job, my parents noticed I was different when I was little. They used to hit me a lot until my mom I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 7. My mom tried her best to help me but I never did well in school and after my sister was hospitalized when I was 12 I never really recovered. I got fat, I became more socially awkward and I never had female interaction. When i was finishing my senior year I decided to make a change, I lost weight and changed my appearance, but I was still the same person. I did everything alone, I ate alone, I slept alone, I went to prom alone, I rotted alone. As soon as I turned 18 I enlisted in the Marine Corps and I met Eme. Everything was going for me, we started dating and eventually we both left for boot camp. Boot camp was tougher for me since I was in a ‚Äútoxic‚Äù company. It was much more difficult mentally and physically, I thought the Marine Corps would make me a man, that it will complete me and change me but I‚Äôm still the same kid I was prior to joining. My SDI told me I was a man but I was still a kid in his eyes, he said we were all his little brothers in his eyes and that we were all kids. He is a great man, he is my idol but I can‚Äôt even keep up. My DI said once ‚Äúbefore a Marine I am a Man‚Äù, I can‚Äôt help but think to myself and ask what am I?. I don‚Äôt know what I am. I‚Äôm still that fat kid who cried alone at night, that same kid who had no friends. I don‚Äôt know what I am. I‚Äôm nothing, Ronald Regan once said ‚ÄúSome people spend an entire lifetime wondering if they made a difference in this world. The Marines don't have that problem‚Äù, but I read that and think what a lie that is. What is my purpose? I have none, my mother keeps me going. I‚Äôm still a kid, but I‚Äôm a also a Marine a Rifleman, before a Marine what am I, what do I have. I have nothing. I am nothing, I‚Äôm worthless, there are so many people who wish they had the chance I got and they would give everything just to be in my shoes. In MCT I got strep, my fever soared Andy throat was closing, I asked a SSGT for the corpsman and I collapsed. I went into shock in the back of JLTV speeding towards a ambulance and I couldn‚Äôt help but close my eyes, I felt so cold, my left eye was going dark, I saw dark spots slowly grow and the corpsman kept sternum rubbing me and telling me to stay awake, stay awake kid. Even then I was a kid, all I could think about was my mom. The Lt colonel came to visit me in the hospital and I asked him if my mom was notified that I was there and he said not yet and if I wanted to call her, I told him no, I couldn‚Äôt let her know I was weak and I failed. He said it wasn‚Äôt my fault but I still asked him to not tell my mom. I could only cry for my mom in silence under a blanket, I was so cold. I was a kid all over again. My dear Eme always took care of me, even in sickness she was there, she left me on a Friday afternoon, ‚Äúyour too immature, you promised to change and you haven‚Äôt‚Äù, ‚Äúyour still a kid‚Äù. I can‚Äôt help but think what if I kept my eyes closed, what if he looked away for just a second and let me submit into the cold dark peace. I have come to realize she was my everything. I‚Äôm sorry for not appreciating you. My friends told me to go on dating apps and I tried but I was too scared to talk to new people. My friends say I have everything going for me, women have told me I‚Äôm attractive, I‚Äôm 18, 5‚Äô10, in Great shape and I hold a great title. But in the inside I‚Äôm still a kid although I have the body of a man and went through trails and tribulations that men have failed in. What am I, our 2nd Lt tells us after every PT that we are worthy and we are loved, that we must seek and show love, joy, peace and patience. It‚Äôs like God sent an angel to tell me to not give up. What am I?. I‚Äôm just another body for the Corps, just another number, I don‚Äôt see myself growing up, my sister said I‚Äôm growing up that‚Äôs it. But what is my purpose. I lose all my friends. I‚Äôm desperate for help and I do everything in silence, with sadness and pain. I‚Äôm so young and I have accomplished something that only 1% have but what is my purpose. I robbed someone of an opportunity. Someone else deserved this, not me, I earned it but at what cost, I lost myself even further after it. She left and in her leaving she took my only chance of happiness. I love her from a distance, it pains me but I still love her. I‚Äôm sorry Eme I didn‚Äôt mean to hurt you. I told her I hope you find a man who will treat you as you deserve, not someone who doesn‚Äôt even know themselves, I hope they treat you better than I ever could. I Hope he does all the things I should have done.

1jkwenj,2025-03-27T06:01:46,"Is there any coming back from untreated long-term psychosis, and if so, how to help someone who doesn't want it?
I'll try to keep this as short as I can, but I want to make sure to give enough context. My brother (43M) was diagnosed with biopolar disorder in his late teens, and after a very rough several years, he really improved in his late 20s and had been largely stable without medication. He and I live several states away, but we've kept in regular contact, especially the last 3 years.

About 22 months ago (summer 2023), he experienced a traumatic event that I now believe may have triggered the beginning of psychosis. He started talking about very dark and concerning things he ""remembered"" from childhood that at the time I couldn't say with certainty were false, but seemed very unlikely to be true. I may have interrupted an attempt at him taking his own life a few weeks after. A few months after that (Oct 2023) he and I did a long camping trip together and had a very nice time, and he had seemed to be back to normal.

Last summer (June 2024) there was another triggering event that made him lash out at my father and cut off communication, which was very sad, but it wasn't the first time he'd gone no-contact because they have a difficult relationship. I've had to be careful since then to avoid the topic because my brother was very angry and blames my dad for difficulties in his own life (which is partially true).

Over the last several weeks, he's been under increasing amounts of stress due to his job contract nearing an end and not having any success finding another opportunity. He believes it's because of my dad that he will lose his job and hasn't been able to find another one (required background checks and some legal trouble my dad got into a long time ago, but my brother has had his own legal troubles as well). He is the sole breadwinner because his partner does not currently work (although he could), and they have a large number of pets to care for. 

A few days ago, we were texting back and forth about lighthearted things and he seemed okay until the conversation started to veer into negative territory. I made a clumsy attempt at changing the subject, and in doing so managed to deeply offend him when saying something that under any normal circumstances would have been easily recognized as a joke. He sent me a picture of a gift I'd gotten him decades prior broken on the floor and told me he didn't know if he wanted to talk to me anymore. I texted his partner to tell him I was concerned about my brother's mental health and asked him to lock up their guns.

The next morning, my brother sent an extremely long email ranting about why he couldn't forgive me and listing out multiple detailed false memories in which myself and both my parents had either emotionally or physically abused him over the years. He referred to himself as an orphan and said he wanted nothing to do with us anymore. I again texted his partner to express grave concern, asked him to look after my brother, and let him know that he can reach out to me if he needs anything. I emailed my brother to apologize for offending him, to explain that I never meant to give the impression I had, and to tell him that I loved him no matter what, but would respect if he needed to take a break. (I did not attempt to refute the false memories because I knew it would not be well-received.)

I messaged my mom to let her know what was going on and suggested she try and continue casually texting with him, but to be prepared in case he decided to push her away as well. To both our surprise, he has continued to respond to her as though nothing is wrong, which gave me hope. But last night, he responded to my email by re-iterating how awful our family is and saying that he would only consider speaking to me again if he managed to keep his job. If his job contract ends with no prospects, he is planning on ending things and had instructed his partner to send prepared letters to each of myself and my parents only after his funeral had passed.

I don't know what to do. Part of me thinks he's so far gone that there's nothing to be done except wait for that awful letter in the mail, and part of me thinks I'm giving up too easily and I need to try and fight to change his mind. But what would I even say? He has no idea that he's so unwell, and seems to believe I'm one of his many tormentors. His partner is timid and passive, and I can't rely on him to intervene. I can't force him to see a psychiatrist or take medication, and would it even help after going untreated for so long? I love him dearly, but I can't see any path that doesn't end with either that letter or a text from his partner confirming the worst. :'(",coming back untreated longterm psychosis help someone doesnt want ill try keep short want make sure give enough context brother 43m diagnosed biopolar disorder late teens rough several years really improved late 20s largely stable without medication live several states away weve kept regular contact especially last 3 years 22 months ago summer 2023 experienced traumatic event believe may triggered beginning psychosis started talking dark concerning things remembered childhood time couldnt say certainty false seemed unlikely true may interrupted attempt taking life weeks months oct 2023 long camping trip together nice time seemed back normal last summer june 2024 another triggering event made lash father cut communication sad wasnt first time hed gone nocontact difficult relationship ive careful since avoid topic brother angry blames dad difficulties life partially true last several weeks hes increasing amounts stress due job contract nearing end success finding another opportunity believes dad lose job hasnt able find another one required background checks legal trouble dad got long time ago brother legal troubles well sole breadwinner partner currently work although could large number pets care days ago texting back forth lighthearted things seemed okay conversation started veer negative territory made clumsy attempt changing subject managed deeply offend saying something normal circumstances would easily recognized joke sent picture gift id gotten decades prior broken floor told didnt know wanted talk anymore texted partner tell concerned brothers mental health asked lock guns next morning brother sent extremely long email ranting couldnt forgive listing multiple detailed false memories parents either emotionally physically abused years referred orphan said wanted nothing us anymore texted partner express grave concern asked look brother let know reach needs anything emailed brother apologize offending explain never meant give impression tell loved matter would respect needed take break attempt refute false memories knew would wellreceived messaged mom let know going suggested try continue casually texting prepared case decided push away well surprise continued respond though nothing wrong gave hope last night responded email reiterating awful family saying would consider speaking managed keep job job contract ends prospects planning ending things instructed partner send prepared letters parents funeral passed dont know part thinks hes far gone theres nothing done except wait awful letter mail part thinks im giving easily need try fight change mind would even say idea hes unwell seems believe im one many tormentors partner timid passive cant rely intervene cant force see psychiatrist take medication would even help going untreated long love dearly cant see path doesnt end either letter text partner confirming worst,3,0,0,Neutral,Low,[],[]

1jkinqr,2025-03-26T19:19:33,"Why do I randomly want nothing to do with my mom?
I (F32) have had a pretty up and down relationship with my mom majority of my life. It's always been hard for me to predict ""which mom"" I'm going to get. When she's great, she's great. But when she's not, she's really not. This would quickly turn into several novels if I fully went into our lore. But the main point is that she's inconsistent. And as a result, so is our relationship. 

About a week and a half ago I moved into my own apartment. After having been back living with her for quite a while. Due to a number of life circumstances. She helped me move in and unpacked majority of my stuff for me. Because it's all just been so emotionally taxing on me. I had no energy to do it myself (again, a novel's worth of an explanation to give the full picture of why I am so beyond burnt out). She stayed with me for the first 4 or 5 days. To continue helping me set my place up, get more things I needed (she spent over $600 just on things i still needed around my place üò≥), and to just be there for emotional support. As change to my norm is not something I handle well. I wouldn't say the first night here alone was a complete breeze. But it didn't take too much longer for me to completely lean in to having my first bit of true alone time in a very very long time. 

What confuses me and I cannot make heads or tails of (this is far from being the first time this has happened) - is how I can go from NEEDING her around me at all times for days... to suddenly feeling like I want nothing to do with her. This time being especially confusing as she's been alarmingly comforting/supportive during the last couple weeks. Yet I somehow slipped into one of these... phases where even relieving a simple txt from her irritates me. Everything bothers me. Yet, simultaneously, on a subconscious level I feel so guilty for feeling that way. Because she has been SO good lately. Had she been awful to me then, sure, of course I wouldn't want to hear from her. Or be around her. And I can never seem to predict when these ""phases"" will happen. Or when they will end.

I went through an assessment a few months ago. Because I felt there were a great deal of things I was experiencing that didn't fit under the umbrella of what I was already diagnosed with. I already knew I have depression, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety. I was shocked to come out of that assessment with... the same diagnoses. No bipolar, no borderline personality disorder.. just depression and a lot of anxiety. However, this assessment unfortunately did not cover developmental issues such as autism and ADHD. Both of which I highly suspected that I have. 

So I don't know.. I don't know what this is, and I certainly don't know how to manage it. And I can't keep living with the guilt of how I imagine it must make my mom feel. And of course, it's not even something I can try to explain to her. Not just cause I don't even understand it myself. But how do you look your mother in the eye and tell her that sometimes you don't want anything to do with her??

1jjqcel,2025-03-25T19:23:54,"I had the baddest panic attack in my adult life and now am scared it will happen again...
#TRIGGER WARNING! Bad case of panic attack!






I've been out for a bit shopping. I was already trying to calm me down from anxiety.

Backstory:

A few months ago my body went full Parkinson mode from taking Lithium and quitting it too fast. I ended up in the neurology ward of our hospital where I underwent a CT, Lumbar Punction and MRI and they found nothing neurological. But still gave me Levodopa. Which I am still taking. The symptoms vanished and I am at my physical normal. Which really is nice.

But lately I have breathing issues. For example I wake up gasping for air and/or having to force my body to breathe again. That scares me. Do I probably have sleep apnea? But sometimes it even feels as if my body is just too lazy and then I have to breathe manually.

I am about to see a lung specialist.

My doctor said that the dose of the Levodopa seems to high. Also it's listed in the side effects that it can have an effect on breathing. I should talk to a neurology doctor. Great. I almost immediately got a panic attack then. They managed to calm me down.

Since then I am just more scared. Sometimes I am just chilling and starting to feel dizzy and have to take a DEEP breath. It's as if I just stopped breathing without noticing. Just now I had it again while I was typing this out.

Fast forward to this afternoon:

I wanted to go shopping. Look for summer clothes. When I was at home I already felt weird. Tried to shake it off and stay calm. But then I was in the shop. I walked around growing more and more concerned. Thinking of asking the staff if I can sit down somewhere. But instead I went outside. Wanted to sit down on a bench. As soon as I started to walk I felt dizzy. I thought I will pass out. I thought if I do in public people would steal my stuff so I decided to go into a Caf√© and order a water.

Inside I stopped and thought of asking for help. I looked at the staff helplessly while turning off my headphones. They didn't notice at all that I was highly unwell. I looked for a table and went there. Sat down. Felt bad. Anxiety rising.

A server came up to me and asked if I am okay. I just told him I think I am having a panic attack. He asked if I want water and I nodded. He brought it. I couldn't move my fingers anymore. I asked for a straw. He brought one. I asked him to stay with me. He did. Tried to calm me down and said he knows how that is.

That's when it happened. My whole body except my eye area and the back of my head started tingling like mad. My hands and fingers cramped and stiffened and I couldn't move them at all anymore. My lung started tingling. I was scared I would die. I couldn't breathe. I got loud. Other guests looked at me. Told me to breathe calmly. Asked if we need water. The server said we have it already. Thanked them.

I couldn't move my face anymore. I barely could talk. It was so scary.

When I finally calmed down I apologized to the guests and they assured me it was okay. One even offered to order a tea but I politely declined saying I had my water and that's enough. I thanked her.

When that attack started the server called an ambulance. I asked him if they were finally there. Until I saw them.

They brought me to the hospital where I am right now waiting for a psych doc. They drew blood from me thrice to look at my oxygen level. Thrice because the first two times they accidentally drew from my vein instead of artery. They checked my blood pressure and my oxygen level with this test thingy you get put on your finger.

I don't know if I have to stay the night. I don't know how I come back home. Thankfully our town is pretty walkable tho. So if I have to I can walk back to my bicycle and then go home.

But I am scared. Scared that it will happen again and that there is nobody to stay with me even tho I have housemates. Scared that I will pass out or worse.

I've had panic attacks since childhood but they have never been like this. I screamed when I had them and I thought I was dying. But I never cramped. Ever. Until a few months ago. I was so scared. And today was the first time it was THAT bad. I couldn't even really move my arms anymore.

1jk08nm,2025-03-26T02:26:26,"I'm in my mid twenties and my life is just a complete mess
**NOTE:THIS POST IS MOSTLY FOR VENTING PURPOSES, BUT ANY QUESTION,  ADVICE, ENCOURAGEMENT, OR MAYBE EVEN FURTHER DISCUSSION IS WELCOME**

Let me start off by saying that I've never visited a professional for the matters I want to talk about , these are just my personal feelings and experiences in my small life.

That being said, I believe that I've gone through a severe phase of being depressed throughout some of my teenage years(more specifically from around 13 to almost 17). Since then, every now and again, I'll fall into what I think could be called depressive episodes. What I mean by that, and what's my experience with them? Well, mostly I put my bad thoughts in a box in the back of my head and try not to touch it. Well sometimes, things happen, or I see something that pushes that box back to the surface and opens it. These episodes used to be longer and going on for maybe a month or three (yes, three). Nowadays, being older, wiser, but well, with more responsibilities, I manage to keep these episodes to only one night, or maybe three to four days at most. What are those like? I'm glad you asked.



These episodes are like a self hating, self loathing back and fourth between me and my brain. Do I hear voices? No, I'm not schizophrenic. But I do hate myself and think how much of a fucking failure I am.

""Oh no, don't say things like that, you're not a failure"" As much as I'd like to be able to say that to myself, when I look at the facts, my oh my, does my self-loathing go on steroid mode.

I'm in my mid twenties, still in uni, living with my parents, no job, no driving, no relationship, no money, no independence. What else do I consider to be wrong with me? Well, despite of being healthy, I'm fat(like 15kg more than my normal weight), I'm balding, my teeth are crooked, my joints hurt, I'm addicted to various versions of pornography, and I'm not sure I can feel 'love' of any kind. Can I recognize it when I see it? Yes. But do I feel loved if and when that sentiment is thrown at me? Absolutely not, and that's probably the reason I don't love myself either.



More specifically, I believe that I'm so much of a disgrace and dead weight, that I actually don't even deserve to be loved. I can not, for God's sake, what the very few people I hold close (namely, my family and some very few friends), see in me. Be it calling me fun, interesting, caring, loving, capable, worthy, put anything you want in there, I don't know how they see it in me. I'm in such disbelief, that I can't fathom the idea of someone finding me useful as a person to have in their life, I feel like I don't have anything to give someone. And that's one of the reasons that I actively have stayed away from relationships, well, even situationships for that matter.



That being said, I've had one semi serious relationship, lasted a couple months and some like 2 very short flings way after that. And I'll use them as examples on how my brain tricks me into thinking the way it does at this point.

The girl I was in a relationship with we started out very casually, I couldn't fathom a serious relationship, she wanted the same(in the start at least). She was also my first in terms of sexual experiences. That's in my early twenties, she was 18. Way more experienced than me. About two months in, she asks me the cliche ""what are we"", proposed an official relationship, I accepted.

Now did I like this girl? A bunch, which was weird in and of itself cause like, I didn't have romantic feelings for anyone for years before that. And honestly, it wasn't that bad. At first at least. After about a month she was just....there. She wasn't trying, she wasn't present, always had something going on. Meanwhile I always made time through my schedule to go out and meet her, even if for a couple minutes, always walked her home and then took the after-night bus for an hour back to my place. Never once did I feel like she really wants me, or really wants to be in this relationship. Eventually she saw the obvious herself, that it wasn't going anywhere and broke up with me, with her being the one crying because she didn't want to really break up and really liked me, but it just wasn't working (I still don't understand????)

Well honestly, it didn't hurt at first, I was feeling kind of numb. Until I was outside of anyone's view, late at night walking to the bus stop, where I broke down weeping. Why? Well because, my whole life I've felt like I'm on the background, the second choice, the not so important one, and no matter how much I tried to make things work with her, no matter what I did, I still wasn't good enough, and honestly I've been telling that to myself for like 10 years now, it's been kinda ingrained in my brain.



Anyways, that ship sailed, we went our separate ways, I was feeling like shit for a few weeks, but not really depressed, but still hated myself for not being good enough. Come along two years later, a very short fling with a girl that never gave me a real chance because she still wanted her ex at heart (despite saying otherwise multiple times when I brought it up), and about half a year later, with another girl which after going on a date, she went ahead and threw herself to the first guy that flirted with her at a party the very next night.

That was a year ago, and I haven't even bothered flirting, asking out, not even having bunter with no purpose. Why's that. Because I know, that chances are, I might get rejected, or put on the sideline, or I can't make things work out. And even though I know that's part of the journey, it happens in life and doesn't mean anything, the moment I am alone at night, in my bed, I'll start thinking about it. How it didn't work out. And why would it? Nothing does. Nothing I do works out, most of the time I know damn well it's my fault. Not talking to people, not trying hard enough in uni, not saving up money, not working out, not doing anything to better myself in general.

I just drown myself and my thoughts in watching movies, or porn, or playing video games.

I have nothing I'm passionate about, I have nothing I can say I love, I have nothing I can say I achieved, I am nothing. I'm the result of actions (or lack therof) and decisions, and all it sums up is to zero, and not only do I hate, loath my existence for it. I hate myself even more that I do not have neither the balls neither the discipline to change my ways and do better, do something to become a better person, to succeed in something, to try and do something so that I don't hate myself so damn much.



This is one of those days. Where I curl up in my bed, staring at a wall, thinking that I'm a failure, I'm unlovable, I have no purpose, I have no use, and I'm so much of a lost cause that I can't even make a step towards bettering myself. In all honesty, I'm not sure what I'm doing with my life, and where this path I'm on is going to lead.





P.S. Let it be known that I'm I haven't been nor am I suicidal. I believe it's mostly because the idea of death and just ""not existing"" scares the living shit out of me. But my point stands.

I'm 21, I have anxiety and OCD. I asked a girl out, we went on two dates. The dates went well. We were acquaintances beforehand. She said she was down to see each other again and offered to give me a hug at the end of the second date. The texting is what is driving me nuts. The two dates were right before spring break. She was only responding after 6 hours and at one point I asked her if she was free Sunday and only responded after two days and said ""Hey! I'm not free Sunday but I am later this week"" and I said ""Sounds good, let me know what day works for you."" 

It's been three days since I sent that and I haven't gotten any response. It's about to be that ""later in the week"" type thing. It's driving me insane. I know I'm young I know there are plenty of fish in the sea. I haven't asked someone out in almost two years and I fell inlove with an idea of a relationship with her because I am obsessive and I overthink. Other girls I have tried to have relationships where it didn't work was because I overwhelmed them for constant reassurance; and this is the one time I tried my absolute best to practice patience and give her space. My mental health has definitely been a cause of failed relationships and this is the one time I think I've done everything right. 

I can't access her thoughts, I don't want to double text, I want to give her space, and all these thoughts are stupid but I cannot control my emotions. 

I tried every coping mechanism I can but I don't have many close friends to distract myself from it and when I do my hobbies I think about her. 

Honestly this is the worst I've felt in so long. I've had to get with every resource possible. This is one of them. Please help me get some peace I can't get out of my head.

1jk0plm,2025-03-26T02:49:58,"30 yrs old/Dealing with managers at work who are petty, assholes, and cause my anxiety flare up.
For context, I work in Hospitality Sales as a coordinator and work with many managers. A few of the managers I work with are a piece of shit and tend to be rude, petty, and snitch. 

I'll admit I have been dropping the ball lately and have not been on top of my game. It's been busy and I have been mentally and physically exhausted from the work load. I've been making mistakes here and there but finding it difficult doing it all.

One manager I work with, we will name as ""Warren"" as of lately has been sending emails to me with my own manager (We will call them ""Wanda"") copied on the email so Wanda is aware Warren's stuff takes priority and is being assigned to me. 

Today, Warren has been nothing but a petty jerk. Basically it was a trainwreck of a day. Started my day with seeing an email from Warren that said ""Why is that there are no reservations for this group?"" Not checking the name of the group, and assuming. One look and I already knew that Warren was not the manager managing the group, but they must've read the first word of the name of the group and assumed it belonged to them. Due to me being over the BS, I email back petty, and pointed out their mistake. 

Afternoon rolls around and more shit arises cause of COURSE the day can't get any worse. WRONG. At this point, I'm pissed and ready to get up and leave. I'm making changes to reservations for a client and respond to their email. They realize I missed a few of the changes and decides to call Warren to talk to them about it. Warren then sent a long winded email with Wanda copied cause Warren is an asshole telling me what was wrong and saying I need to be more thorough when reviewing before sending stuff out. 

Let me put it this way, the client only highlighted the stuff they needed modified, but DID NOT flag what they wanted removed. They decided to remove it from their spreadsheet and not let me know. NO way in hell am I going to take extra time to go through line by line and match it with what I have on my system to see what they no longer need if they did not flag it on the excel sheet.

I have not been this mentally drained in so long. Luckily I am actively in therapy and taking care of myself when I can but wow is this job so taxing at times. I just needed to vent as my entire day was horrible and consisted of one bad thing after the other. I have my 1:1 with my manager Wanda and I know they will bring all of the mishaps from this week up.

1jk352b,2025-03-26T04:57:49,"I need to get myself help, but I really don't know what to do... or what I can do, so I would really like some advice or support please.
Hi everyone, (I've never actually posted before, so sorry if it's bad or really long, but that's probably just me and my overthinking... *please* don't be too harsh in the comments if you *do* choose to say something) and you can call me Keys.

So, many things in my life are not going so well (and by many I mean probably too many to explain in one post, and by not so well, I mean ***TERRIBLY***), and I just don't know what to do. Surviving like this somehow for **so** long has been hard enough, and getting through spring break **ALMOST** broke me. But I **still** showed up for school. I knew my friends and the people in my very special group would need me, and that they'd be very upset if they found out something bad happened to me. And all of us in this certain group at school (I **really** want to say what it is, but if I do, I will out myself and people from my school will know that this is **definitely** me, so I won't...)

In elementary school, I knew I wouldn't last, and I only imagined some dream of a future that would *never* exist. Yet somehow, I managed to stay then, and throughout middle school, *and* years of high school too (more than one). And every holiday, break, weekend, or even almost every single period of time when I'm not with the people I care about, I am ***devastated***. My household doesn't treat me well at **all** emotionally, other adults in authority have *never* helped (but I hope things change this time, since I went to the super-unhelpful school staff about it, and they have ""*legal responsibilities*"" and all that), and high school academics are **so** stressful.

To keep this as short as possible and leave me some time to work on other things, I *will* say:

I need some supports in school, because not ever getting any (and only being yelled at by teachers too for years, though currently all my teachers are lovely <3) has ***GLITTERALLY*** been killing me, from mentally, to grade-wise (though I am *not* failing for some reason), and also physically (too many things going on there too). My parents let me get tested for things but denied the start of the getting-me-help process last school year, and us ""minors"" can't do anything to help ourselves without ""*parental consent*"", and the staff dropped the case on me and they would have to start again **next** year, which is too late, and I'm doomed...

I am not allowed to go to therapy (for a lot of reasons, of course), and the last several people I saw were not very helpful at all. They knew about the abuse and mistreatment, yet **STILL** chose to keep on ignoring it (since it wasn't physical anymore), and they kept only *acting* nice and not so outwardly mean so people wouldn't suspect anything. I've **been** needing to get help for a really long time, but at *least* I have supportive friends now, otherwise I'd be long gone... And my parents think ""shoving meds down \[my\] throat"" will miraculously ""*fix*"" me, but I **know** (and they better, too) that's not how it works, **and** when they tried to do that to me years ago, they **saw** it not work with ***their own eyes***.

**And**, on top of these, which are only **some** of the main issues I can think of currently, I am not allowed to see my best friend who used to be my best neighbor buddy anymore. My parents say it's ""all \[my\] fault for telling the school who reported them to \[a certain supposedly-minor-protecting agency\] who called my friend's parents and now they will never let them see such a *bad influence* like \[me\] ever again, \[I'm\] **so** disgusting"" and a bunch of blamey and gaslighty things like that. They **always** speak *SO* rudely of me to other people **and** straight to me too. And if not that, they yell across the HUGE and awfully empty expensive house to my sibling (and I'm physically closer half the time) until I break from all the unnecessary loudness and unshush myself and *TRY* telling them to go over to *her* and yell all they want, but then I get caught in the crossfire anyway, and it gets worse and my constant stream of passive self-naughty and soupyslidey thoughts gets worse and to stop myself from going through with the latter without a fully-fledged plan (and distract myself from finishing that plan), I... sometimes do the former, and by sometimes I mean it's been getting even more terrible and much more frequent too and I **really** don't want it and all my healths to get any worse and I *know* I should go and get help but it's not working, oh, *and*...

My phone, which isn't the most conventional kind (and saying what it is will out me, again, since I'm pobably the only one for MILES around with a phone like mine, and it's obvious too, since I *love* to take pictures with it a lot), has stopped working for almost a month. On the first of this month, I was at an event, and I took a lot of pictures, and my phone storage said it was almost full for a few months before that, and now it's all my fault for not listening and making it crash with all my photo-taking and now I must suffer the consequences. But, since I got a new battery recently, at least the logo shows up on the screen again (but now it won't turn off just like it did that fateful day so the new battery needs to come out too), but I'm really worried that I won't get to see my media like my photos (obviously by now), chats, notes, recordings, contacts, and all those things again... and that's ***REALLY*** been upsetting for me.

And I can't talk to my household about getting gender-affirming care, and my dysphoria is killing me too. They've known and I've been out for **so** many years, yet they don't give a *fluff* about it, no matter how I try to explain (and the last therapist sort of explained a little, but not thoroughly enough, which wasn't good either...), they *still* refuse to budge, and waiting for the ""law"" to release me isn't okay, since I won't be able to do suddenly do everything all by myself the day after I'm completely restricted from doing **any** independent things at all (I mean after the courts declare me over 18).

**Finally**, yesterday, after knowing what my parents said about not seeing my bestie ever again, and living in a *super*\-lonely isolated suburban neighborhood and not talking to my sibling for nearly a year due to *reasons*, my best buddy at the school I attend didn't show up to our special group thing yesterday morning, which worried me, since we didn't see each other over spring break either, and they weren't at school all day yesterday, so I emailed them and found out that they wouldn't be at school **or** in our group for a while, and they only said ""a while"" to comfort me probably, but I ***know*** it will be a really long time, since today our group members had to fill in for their part and make do somehow. It is ***so*** depressing, and the people who have heard what happened and probably got more information than what my friend told me, said (to each other) that they couldn't talk about the details, and most of our shared friend group has no idea and just think they're absent... it ***truly*** broke my heart yesterday, and it keeps shattering into more and more tiny pieces indefinitely. I feel like it was my fault for venting excessively and bringing their mental health down too, even though I was reassured by them multiple times that doing so (asking for advice and complaining and reaching out for help I mean) was okay. And we are really good at hiding things like our feelings and such, because of the nature of our group, and that isn't helping us either. 

But even though all this (*AND* more) is happening, and will happen and get **worse** since we're nearing the end of the school year, I KNOW I have to continue trying to stay strong and positive, if not for myself, then for *all* the rest of us. Because losing *one* person temporarily (hopefully) is bad enough, and we can't have another being gone permanently, and besides, this isn't my year to end it. I WILL try to stay and experience majorhood like I thought my fantasy someday-self might, and **then** decide. So I will do my ***absolute*** best to keep my fragile eggshell of a self together, even if I crack and ooze out all my sides.

Thank you so much for reading, and I hope this long message (and the future advice I hope it gets) helps someone in the future, even if my own story fails. Also, I *will* be borrowing my other friend's phone to text hotlines again like I did between classes today (and maybe even call if I'm brave enough to speak aloud), to get advice from those experienced adults too, since the web chats have **never** helped or worked fast enough (they even said once that they were out of ideas and my situation is hopeless! who says that?! **I** may be exhausted, but *they* can't be just giving up!).

Take care of yourselves if you are able, and try not to be too naughty, because the people who care *are* looking out for you. üëÄ

Hi all, I‚Äôve never posted on Reddit before or asked for online advice but I figured I‚Äôd give it a go. For most of my life I‚Äôve had waves of obsessive (not implying I have OCD, just in nature) spirals of negative thoughts, either falling into the category of ‚ÄúI am a bad person‚Äù or ‚ÄúThis cannot be changed.‚Äù If that doesn‚Äôt make much sense- I either hyper-fixate on things I‚Äôve done or qualities I used to have, things I can rationally understand are part of childhood and growing up, but I try to convince myself I am in some way tainted as a human being because of them. Or, I hyper focus on something, usually about a romantic partner, once in a while a friend, that I cannot change about them. I am usually able to do this in silence and not let this specific thought process impact my relationships, but the depression and anxiety brought on from my internal spirals usually effects the relationship in some form. The hard part is I have rational breaks from my thoughts when I feel ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù and less hyperfixated, and I feel relieved and then panicked about how I acted, was perceived, or if others were able to tell the amount of distress I felt on the inside. But usually those are short lived breaks. I don‚Äôt know if this makes sense to anyone, or if they‚Äôve experienced something similar. I have a great therapist and am currently trying to figure out medications, and have been trying to do a lot to take care of myself and my mental health.

My spouse has a history of trauma and abuse from childhood. Lately she has started to slap her face and forehead at random times of the day. I continue to tell her to stop and to do anything else but harm herself, but she never does. She spoke with her therapist about it and they say its mainly her attempt to distract herself from the thoughts she has about past trauma. I really dont feel like this is a solution, because she will slap herself sometimes in the dead of night so loud that it wakes me up. She is on all kinds of medications and everything but nothing helps.

Im struggling with this because her condition has been getting worse ever since she started therapy. In my head it feels like they gaslight her into thinking whats going on is ok and its valid to feel the way she does (and it is, just not like this) but thats not helping her get better. She cries more often, the slapping started and now she gets short tempered. Im not sure how to help her because of my own mental health stuff making me disconnected from my emotions from ptsd.

CW: drug mention, self-harm mention

I (M30) live with my friend (M27) and his ex-partner (NB27). When they started dating, it was just him and I, but then the partner moved in shortly after the beginning of the relationship. It became clear that it was soon fraught with fighting, arguing of an indeterminate nature, but I didn't do or say anything in favor of just letting them conclude the relationship whenever it got to be too much. I was, at this point, unaware of the specific mental health status of the partner (who we will call A).

As it happens, after a particularly nasty episode, A came storming down the stairs and yelled at me as an evident continuation of the prior argument, and said ""and you're a f*cking psychopath, don't even TRY to play dumb"".

What followed was a tirade that I can only describe as a psychotic break, accusing me and him of abusing A, manipulating them, teaming up, lying, god knows what else, saying how dare you do this to a mentally ill, suicidal person. The roommate (call him K) came downstairs to try calming things down, and A tearfully asked if he was going to kill them.

It was at that point I said, out loud, ""K, we need to call emergency services or something"", and A blew up and begged and pleaded and chastised me for saying that and K additionally discouraged me doing that as well (albeit calmer). So I didn't.

I asked K later for context, and he told me A has BPD and has outbursts like this frequently, and has a paranoid belief that K and me have been secretly hooking up during their whole relationship. We haven't, ever.

As things stand, A and K are both unemployed, K owns the house and gets unemployment but A doesn't have any support structures apart from a friend or two, and if A is kicked out, they will be homeless. They have both discussed medication and therapy, but for the aforementioned financial reasons, this has yet to take place. A is also a ketamine user and smokes tons of weed every day.

I live in the state of Washington. Are there any affordable ways that A can be cared for or supported that don't involve just continually living here and undergoing cycles of psychosis and paranoia? This is not a sustainable situation. I have preexisting plans to move in with my girlfriend soon, but until then, this is where I live.

1jj9fao,2025-03-25T03:43:50,"Help me idk what to do anymore and I'm scared
I've been feeling bad for a few weeks now. I've had depression and anxiety since I was 12. I'm autistic and I've been an undiagnosed anorexic for almost 4 years now. It's usually manageable I'm 21 I know how to deal with things and I'm on meds that help calm the worst parts down. It hasn't been that bad not like it was before I got on meds but I still don't feel like myself and usually I can wait it out but this time I can't. 

I don't leave my room except for school and work on the weekends. I don't have the mental energy to do anything not even watch a YouTube video about something that normally I'd be into. I still watch things but it's old stuff that I'd watch back in hs before things got more difficult. I still like them they bring me comfort but I think it's weird I can't focus on the new stuff that I know normal me would be interested in that I like my usual documentary and drama channels but I just don't have the brain space for it I guess. 

I feel numb alot. I can't focus on my schoolwork which since I'm in the last 6 weeks of the semester is something I'm really freaking out over. Luckily my English class is in person and it's more of an if you show up you pass thing also English is an easy grade for me despite the trouble I have with my professor nothing bad he just in his words dosent do computers so most of our work in class is worksheets and we only submit our essays online because it's required I think and he takes forever to get them back. 

Last one I turned my paper in the day after it was released about 2 weeks early because he changed the deadline the next day because he messed something up. He waited till the day the paper was due to tell me I had messed something up and had to redo it. You can imagine how stressed I was. Thank god my girlfriend helped me with the rewrite cuz idk how I could have done it myself in one day. It's been 2 weeks btw and I still haven't gotten it back. I finally asked him about it today he said he forgot about it but he should have it graded in a week or two. Today's class we were supposed to be researching for our last essay of the semester before our final exam but he forgot to double check with the librarian so we did not do that today. Was kinda disappointed cuz that's one of my favorite things about writing and I picked an interesting topic for my essay. Instead we just spent the class period doing a practice quiz for our exam which I'm pretty sure I failed. 

I just can't do anything right my focus is bad things go in one ear out the other. Even when I should know the answer it's literally right in front of me I just can't get it and it's so frustrating I want to cry. I missed a few of the online zoom meetings for my french online class. They're not mandatory but we have to show up at least 7 times before the semester. I haven't been to one all month and I still have 3 more left to do. 

My history class is also online. It's the most simple class I have but also the most difficult. It's always just reading the textbook and regurgitating it back on a paper. It's very time consuming and I've had to learn with this class how to manage time and do an hour or two of work on the paper for a few days because you can't write an entire chapter overview in one afternoon like you can with most other assignments. So for my history last weeks assignment didn't get done. I had the questions written out I tried to read the textbook answer was literally right in front of me but it just didn't stick in one ear out the other. I know I can do it compared to a whole chapter overview a few questions even if they're essay style should be easy but I just couldn't. I feel bad it was due yesterday at midnight but I just couldn't do it. Idk what's wrong with me my grades can't afford to slip not now not when I'm so close to finishing the semester. 

I usually can just wait episodes like this out but I can't do that now I have responsibilities and stuff. I've had thoughts of suicide alot lately. I haven't attempted anything but last week I kinda ended up locking myself in my room scared to death cuz I was so close to doing something. It was a really tough night texted a hotline twice but idk if they really helped. Last night at work I felt so close again it took over if I wasn't at work I would have slashed my arm up bad. I ate a burger there at work got freaked out cuz of the calories and it just spiraled from there. My girlfriend managed to talk me down later when I was almost done with work so when I got home I didn't do anything but I know I was close literally if I wasn't at work I'd be having to wear long sleeves for weeks till the cuts healed.

Idk what to do anymore. I don't want to do anything but I have to be myself again. I don't want to let normal me down. I don't want my girlfriend to worry about me so much she's the best thing in my life and I want to be better for her. I tried taking weed the day after my first suicidal episode. I don't do it often my parents are really strict and I'm scared of my mom but I'm at home alone alot when I don't have school or work so I was free to do it. I didn't take too much just enough to calm me down and it did help. I was calm and happy almost for the rest of the day and part of the next day too but it didn't really last so now I know that whatever is going on isn't something as simple as I need to relax. 

I just want someone to listen and tell me what to do because I don't know and I don't think I want to experiment with drugs the last one my psychiatrist put me one turned me into someone else. I wasn't me like I was but there was something else taking over my body I wasn't acting or thinking right. I stopped taking them after 2 or 3 weeks. It was the most unsettling experience I've ever had with a drug and I don't ever want to go through that again. I'd rather be me but anxious and depressed than a pod person.

1jitjpc,2025-03-24T16:35:01,"Mostly a Neurodivergent Rant
Hello All,

As a preface, suggestions and help are appreciated, but I have been doing obsessive research on all of my mental health, so keep that in mind.  I (M39) will try to be as open as possible about myself inside and out as I go, but this account is also anonymous so I have to clip details when they get a little too personal.

TL;DR:  I thought I was making progress, only to have new setbacks and it has not quite exactly filled me with hope.  I haven't given up nor do I intend to on finding solutions and answers for myself, but damn, I feel like I got reset to square 1.

Okay, formalities out of the way, hey all.

So recently I was advised to do a neuropsych exam because I have been diagnosed with ADHD for about 10 years now and told my current therapist that I feel something else is at play.  Turns out, there was. While knowing this changes nothing if left untreated, and I can continue on as normal, I obviously want to correct my shortcomings.  Here is a short list, starting with diagnoses and then moving on into terms that may be mental health related but also may not be a thing in themselves.

-ADHD  

-Depression  

-Generalized Anxiety  

-PTSD (SA Victim+Bullying+Life)  

-Dissociative Amnesia (Its not terrible, but concerning for sure.)  

-Dissociation/Depersonalization  

-RSD (Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria)  

-PDA (Pathological Demand Avoidance)  

-Autism Traits (PTSD is blocking the ability to diagnose/rule out autism.)  

-Alexithymia  

-Merinthophobia  

-(Claustrophobia?)  The above might be the true problem here, just recently found out there was a word for fear of being bound (tl;dr its the phyical state of being bound that panics me, not the idea of it.)  

-Acrophobia  

-Possible Borderline  

-Possible but unlikely Bipolar  

-Emotional Numbness  

-Executive Dysfunction, like this is the worst symptom I think I have.  0 Ability to prioritize.  

-Porn Addiction? (Look, it probably is, but if so, its just over the line so IDK?  I don't want to admit it to myself for some reason.  Will check porn in inappropriate places, but privately of course.)  

-Video Game Addiction? (This was bad, but has now stabilized, I guess.  Not sure if it was ever an addiction since I used to game like 60hr/wk and now its like 10 if I am lucky, but I also had nothing much else to do so back then, so is it an addiction if you choose to fill your free time with it?)  

-Very strong need for perfectionism at times  

-Very strong need to know the answer to a question if it suits me. (Will obsessively chase an answer for days even if its not worth it.)  

-Very strong rejection reaction when I get blindsided by perceived harsh or  incorrect criticism.  

I think that's it, just mainly typing the list out for myself so I have a reference point.  

Note#1: While I am going to talk about my relationship at times and it may not sound rosy, the relationship itself is not a thing that is a debate for me.  If you have helpful comments that build communication, I welcome them, but debate on if I should leave/stay is not welcomed.  Please just trust me that if you're thinking something, I have already analyzed many different aspects to our relationship and I choose to move forward knowing what I know.  Its very hard to sneak intentions past me.  

Note#2: I am open to DMs if you'd like to privately discuss anything mental health related at any time, if something in my post resonates with you.  Discussions only though, don't just DM me to ask a bunch of questions about myself or my symptoms.  I would rather  questions about my mental health issues be asked here so that maybe someone could benefit from the post one day.  

Note#3: This is intended to essentially be a journal of sorts as the act of writing all of this out is my therapy.  As such, I probably will update and edit it until I feel it has served its purpose.  

Now, lets get to why I am here, venting.  

So, I guess I could stop here and just go AHHHH LOOK ABOVE DO I NEED TO GO ON?  But, I won't do that today.  So, yeah lets get to current day then I guess walk it back as I go.  So, about a couple months ago, I got diagnosed with Dissociative Amnesia and PTSD with autism traits.  I had suspected something was fucking with my memory that wasn't just ADHD.  I started to wake up and realize that memory gaps in my life are not normal, and after some googling, I found some things that could cause what I have.  Walked in theorizing one of the aforementioned could be the culprit, WHOOPS, might be all 3.    

So here I am sitting with this new information, and no clue now where to go from here.  I felt that my management of ADHD was already a task, and now I gotta try to walk back habits and trauma minted 20-30 years ago.  This new information helped me and hurt me.  Now, I have some new information and with that comes the tools to treat said disorders, YAY!  Oh but wait, now I realize I know very little about treating these things and unlike ADHD, there isn't usually a little magic pill to help you along halfway.  Not to say you can't manage without medication, but I think it's safe to say it helps.  It was a sobering reality and I kinda just went into a depression shortly after the diagnosis.  After recovering from that, I really needed a new plan, which I am working with my therapist on.  

I think the most frustrating out thing out of all of these issues is it means that I am confused like half the time (trying not to be hyperbolic, might be less, but is significant.) as to where I am, what I am doing, what I was saying, really anything.  My ADHD or Amnesia frequently erases my immediate term memory and then my ADHD or Amnesia also erases weeks at a time of details when I get overwhelmed.  Its not total forgetfulness, and with the right reference, I can recall things.  But my mind will just go oh hey, logic took over for a while, you can be a human again out of nowhere, then I quickly realize that I have been depressed/stressed for a month.  I have vague memories of this timeframe, almost none of the details, but I get a good enough feeling that I existed and carried on as normal as I could during that period, so its not a concerning loss of memory, just...really annoying?  Often times my memory will cause interpersonal issues, as I will tell the same story 16 times to everyone I know, but possibly not even remember even one instance, for example.  That means me being told things is always subject to not making it to the hard drive in my head, and it happens more frequently when I don't want to do something.  


Moving on to another thing, the RSD and PDA.  These are also a couple of the worst, because the RSD makes me feel legitimately crazy sometimes and the PDA just defiantly flies in my face inhibiting my own plans and goals.  I have to fucking agree with my brain on tasks, otherwise it's the hardest thing in the world now to me.  It looks like I'm just being childish, but I can't understate how much mental effort it takes to overcome this feeling somtimes.  Imagine telling your brain no, then it just says ""fine, try doing your task without me,"" then proceeds to become a paperweight and I either get no thoughts or a mixture of my brain telling me what to do vs me trying to do affirmations to override the block, with limited success.  Then, I get RSD with myself because I don't want to let #1 down, so I get emotional and upset because I can't do something I should be able to.  If only I could show everyone what this dynamic is like in real life, because, almost all of the time, I get ""you're lazy, you're just trying to get out of work,"" or ""its not that big of a deal just do it.""  Internal me knows all of this, knows that it is my own mind holding me back, and it doesn't change anything.  I would love to have my chores done all the time, I even feel great from the satisfaction, but my brain seems to think work is for suckers.  

The last point I'll make for now is:  

Well hey at least I get benefits of my brain being ridiculously good at specific things due to some of these issues.  WISH I COULD JUST BE NORMAL AND DO WORK NOW   

PS:  RSD also is paralyzing me in social situations and makes me feel crazy for getting upset because I took something the wrong way.  

P.P.S: I want to also touch on the emotional numbness later.  

P.P.P.S:  I may get into it, but my S/O cannot help me with my journey at this time, so that's why I chose reddit to vent to.

All of my friends are lovely but I feel alone. And I'm not in the best family ever to have support so I have this thoughts.

1jiwuc3,2025-03-24T18:46:41,"I really think I was mistreated by the police, and I‚Äôm pretty sure they didn‚Äôt file paperwork?
So, it‚Äôs kind of a long story but I will try to be succinct. I have mental health issues (C-PTSD), and they were being exacerbated by the abusive environment I was in, greatly. At one point I reached out to a mental health crisis team in the area and I was given the option of a short term stay at a mental health respite place. I figured it was worth a shot, so I went. When I got there, there was only one employee and she was acting, in my opinion at least, very unprofessional, immature, and disinterested-and became pretty rude when I said as much. 

(The behaviors I noticed were her pretty much being annoyed when I even showed up because she had to get off her phone, and her absolute disinterest in the process of checking me in.)

I continue talking a bit of shit as I get amped up emotionally, she continues handling it really poorly for a supposed mental health professional. At a certain point she deemed me to be too belligerent and called the police-again, at no point was she professional or trying to work with me, she was just very dismissive and disinterested. As someone who‚Äôs been in mental health centers a handful of times, this just didn‚Äôt seem appropriate to me.

Anyway-the police arrive, and keep in mind, this was Texas‚Ä¶so, naturally they were douchebags. They didn‚Äôt listen to my side at all, kept telling me to stop talking. The woman‚Äôs boss showed up and was also talking down to me, trivializing/mocking the state of my mental health, and said that she worked at my then therapy clinic and basically threatened to tattle on me there. 
Then, the police tell me I have two options; stay there and shut up, or walk home alone. It was around midnight or 1 am, and I am a petite woman. That didn‚Äôt seem safe to me, I was about to suck it up and sleep until morning, and then the first woman‚Äôs superior revoked that option and said they ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt want me there.‚Äù

The police said, ‚ÄúYou heard her. Grab your stuff and start walking home.‚Äù
I felt trapped and panicked and thought, I‚Äôm not going to risk getting assaulted (or worse) on the way home, I have to do something. Then I proceeded to punch the original staff member I had encountered in the face, so that I could spend the night in jail and not wandering around the streets of a city I had just moved to with a dead phone. I KNOW, it wasn‚Äôt the smartest move in retrospect-particularly not in front of two police. Obviously, I got arrested.

They were quite rough, despite me hitting her once and then laying myself down on the floor with my hands behind my back. I felt a knee digging into me, the handcuffs click firmly around my wrist-and then, 3 more clicks as I feel them squeeze my circulation off. They openly mocked me with their words.

When I arrived at the jail, I was still pretty upset, and panicking-it didn‚Äôt help that they put me in a creepy windowless concrete cell with an intercom to communicate with and a grate in the floor to piss in, complete with an actual dead rodent inside. Also, no bed. I used the intercom to notify them that I needed my epilepsy meds, which I had on my person when I was arrested. I was told that I was on detox (???) so I couldn‚Äôt have my medication. I told them I wasn‚Äôt arrested on drug or alcohol charges, but even if I were I‚Äôm pretty sure detox doesn‚Äôt include prescription medications. They ignored me, and when I didn‚Äôt drop it, they turned off my intercom-my only way of communicating with them if I *did* have a seizure.

In the morning, literally the second I could, I bailed out and I haven‚Äôt heard anything since, no court summons or anything like that. Apparently it‚Äôs still not on my record, either.

I generally don't know what to do with my life.
I can't feel emotions or empathy, I'm just empty all the time. I don't want to do anything at all either, and the only reason for that is that I don't see the point. I'm just going to die one day so why does what I do in the meantime matter? I know I hate my family, and I don't have any friends, not that it changes anything. I don't have anyone to turn to, I'm truly alone. When I look to the future, I don't see the point in it. Why bother when you'll die and then be forgotten one day? I'm hopeless, and I don't know what to do to change it. No matter what I do I don't feel, I don't love and I don't care. What's the point in life if living itself can be so cruel?

I don't know nor do I understand what I am supposed to do in life. I was always called a genius kid or an old soul. But because of this, I was never told how to try, I was always comfortable with being the way I was. So much so that I never tried to improve, and look where that got me. I don't even know if there's anything I can do to feel better. I go to a therapist and have been for the past year, but all that's got me is online schooling and that isn't even helping. I feel like I just need to be locked away and forgotten, maybe that would be the best outcome.


I'm sorry if this was too much or too heavy of a subject but I really needed to get this off of my mind. I don't know if anything could help me at this point but if anyone at all has ideas of what I can do to try and feel better please tell me.

For the past 8 months my life has gone from the best I'd ever been to the lowest I've ever felt and I feel like I'll never recover. 8 months ago my grandma died of a heart attack and in the following months my grandpa's health started to decline as well due to old age, stress, etc...he ended up being in a vegetative state. it had mentally destroyed me and made going on with my normal life impossible. I've had suicidal thoughts and completely petrifying depression since my grandma passed and my girlfriend had been very supportive for me. She knew I was depressed but not suicidal. I eventually told her during an emotional breakdown where I just randomly started crying out of the blue and all she said was ""okay"". I thought in my hysterical state I was just receiving her comment wrong but it didn't sit right with me and it made me more upset but I tried to hide it the best I could. Then 3 months ago she breaks up with me and says that she doesn't feel loved the way that she deserves to be. But she still cares about me and wants to keep in contact with me because of the way I'm feeling. I'm absolutely defeated by this i don't have the emotional strength to fight this decision I'm just broken. But we stayed in loose contact messaging every few days when she'd check on me for about a month. Then she stopped. I waited almost 2 weeks and asked her if she was busy cause I wanted someone to talk to about how I was feeling and that I missed her. She just flat out tells me to get over it that it been almost 2 months and to move on. I find out from a mutual friend that's she's already with someone else. How can people be like this. I lost people that I care about and you punish me for it. I need someone and she lied to me just pretending to care. I feel absolutely wronged and I feel so empty.

1jiloha,2025-03-24T09:08:21,"It feels like we are falling apart..
I am 17 years old ‚Äî a boy trapped in a cycle of self-destruction.
I procrastinate, I watch porn, I vape, I carve my pain into my skin.
For five years, I have been nothing but a ghost.
Now, I have no friends.
Not one.
My family, lost in their own vices, drowns out my presence.
Often, I just want to disappear forever.

She is 18.
A girl with a heart too big for this world.
She calls herself a people pleaser.
Unfortunately she gives until there‚Äôs nothing left of her.
Life never made things easy.
People used her, betrayed her, left scars too deep to fade.
She‚Äôs lost good friends, suffered panic attacks that steal the air from her lungs.
She believes she doesn‚Äôt deserve food, doesn‚Äôt deserve care.
She cuts herself.
She has tried to die ‚Äî more than once.

And yet, somehow, we found each other.

It started three months ago.

That night, I tried to end my life.
But morning came, and I was still here.
So I wrote.
Poured my pain into a Reddit post, hoping someone, anyone, would hear me.
No one did.

Until her.

She sent a message.
Told me she was sorry.
That I deserved more.
Gave me words I never knew I needed.
I thanked her, thinking that was the end of it.

But the next day, she asked if I had eaten.
If I had drunk enough water.
(At the time, I barely ate at all.)
I answered.
Then I answered again.
And again.
And again.

Soon, we spoke every day.
Hours passing like seconds.
We unraveled everything‚Äîour pasts, our fears, our dreams, the pieces of ourselves we never dared to show the world.
There was no judgment.
No shame.
Only understanding.

Weeks passed before we understood.

One evening, I bought flowers, took a picture, and told her she meant the world to me.
She was quiet at first.
Then, she told me she loved me.
A moment later, I said it back.
It felt so right.

We grew closer.
Every whispered ‚ÄûI love you,‚Äù every ‚ÄûI wish I could hold you‚Äù, every ‚ÄûI want to fall asleep beside you and wake up to your warmth‚Äù pulled us deeper into something neither of us had ever known.
For both of us it's the first relationship.

And then came desire.

The thought of her ignited something inside me.
A longing.
To touch.
Neither of us has ever known intimacy, but if we were together, we would.
Slowly. Gently. Desperately.
Not just for the act itself, but for the connection, the feeling of being real in each other‚Äôs arms.
She wants that.
I want that.
We developed passionate fantasies together.
She tells me she would give herself to me completely.
She says it over and over.

But the world is cruel.
We are over six thousand kilometers apart.
Don't speak the same language.
Our English is bad.
It leaves no room for calls, for video, for more than just words on a screen.
We are trapped in distance, in silence.
And it is unbearable.
I'm also scared of direct contact.
It's so complicated.

She loves me with every piece of herself.
I know that.
But I cannot let her cling to a shadow she will never touch.
And yet, she won‚Äôt let go.
‚ÄûAnything for you.‚Äù

I am still that same lost boy, drowning in my own darkness.
I am immature.
I am not a good person.
Not even close.
And yet, I make her happy.
I don‚Äôt understand why, but I do.

I can‚Äôt even maintain a normal friendship.
How could I ever hold onto love?
All the dreams we share ‚Äî I know they will never become reality.
And it crushes me.
It makes me want to scream.

I don‚Äôt want to lose her.
She is my first love.
My only love.
The deepest connection I have ever known.
But I feel us slipping.

If I walk away, I fear she won‚Äôt survive it.
And I cannot bear that weight.

But if we stay, this pain will only grow.
I know that, too.

What am I supposed to do?
What the hell am I supposed to do?

I don‚Äôt want to let her go.
Because if I do, I will never find someone like her again.
Never.",feels like falling apart 17 years old boy trapped cycle selfdestruction procrastinate watch porn vape carve pain skin five years nothing ghost friends one family lost vices drowns presence often want disappear forever 18 girl heart big world calls people pleaser unfortunately gives theres nothing left life never made things easy people used betrayed left scars deep fade shes lost good friends suffered panic attacks steal air lungs believes doesnt deserve food doesnt deserve care cuts tried die yet somehow found started three months ago night tried end life morning came still wrote poured pain reddit post hoping someone anyone would hear one sent message told sorry deserved gave words never knew needed thanked thinking end next day asked eaten drunk enough water time barely ate answered answered soon spoke every day hours passing like seconds unraveled everythingour pasts fears dreams pieces never dared show world judgment shame understanding weeks passed understood one evening bought flowers took picture told meant world quiet first told loved moment later said back felt right grew closer every whispered love every wish could hold every want fall asleep beside wake warmth pulled us deeper something neither us ever known us first relationship came desire thought ignited something inside longing touch neither us ever known intimacy together would slowly gently desperately act connection feeling real others arms wants want developed passionate fantasies together tells would give completely says world cruel six thousand kilometers apart dont speak language english bad leaves room calls video words screen trapped distance silence unbearable im also scared direct contact complicated loves every piece know cannot let cling shadow never touch yet wont let go anything still lost boy drowning darkness immature good person even close yet make happy dont understand cant even maintain normal friendship could ever hold onto love dreams share know never become reality crushes makes want scream dont want lose first love love deepest connection ever known feel us slipping walk away fear wont survive cannot bear weight stay pain grow know supposed hell supposed dont want let go never find someone like never,1,0,0,Neutral,High,[],[]

Hi. I've always struggled a little with my mental health, but at the moment it's so bad it's very overwhelming. I feel like a lot of issues and insecurities have piled up on me and I don't know where to start unravelling them. I have a few goals for what I need to work on, so if anybody could share what helps them I'd appreciate it.

For context I will add that I was diagnosed with epilepsy last year, and I was put on keppra, a medicine that made me incredibly depressed. I am coming off it now but it's a very slow process so I have minimum a month more of essentially chemical depression to go, and I've never been so close to ending things so I need ways to get through the next little while at least.

1. I have a strong fear of judgement and abandonment when it comes to friends. Friendships are extremely important to me but after years of being the boring smart friend I always assume the worst even with the best people. I need to learn some confidence in my authentic self and how to be more lenient with people while still not getting walked over (because I am a people pleaser).

2. I need little ways to make my busy tiring college days a bit brighter, and ways to appreciate what I have. When I get home I have to go to bed very early since I commute so much, so i have less time for my hobbies then I'd like. 

Some suggestions of journalling or CBT exercises that helped you with depression or anxiety would also be brilliant.

My mental health is at its lowest due to me not having self control. I (18f) has always been insecure about my weight since I‚Äôve been in 2nd grade. When I was in 2nd grade I gained a lot of weight over the summer due to my over eating. In that time my mom made it very known she didn‚Äôt like it. Making fun of me in front of my family, friends , and waitresses. Yelling at me for wanting McDonald‚Äôs like the rest of the kids in my family. Even one memory of her coming home drunk from a bar making me sit in the living room as she told me how pretty I would be if were skinny. And how many guys would want me. My way to cope with all of the stuff was eating more which sounds stupid. I was heavy until my 8th grade when I had my first crush on this boy. During that time, I only ate one thing a day that way I would lose weight and be skinny. Cuz in my head the only way anyone would want me if I was skinny. I lost the weight and my mom was so happy with me. I worked out everyday. Only at 500 to 100 cal for a long time. When I got into sophomore year I started eating normal cal and working out a lot.

So I took to pills and in my luck i ended up gain 20lb. It sucked cuz I wasn‚Äôt even allowed to work out anymore. I everything turned around my mom and I started fighting again.

I will try to sensor any triggering words with $ or symbols in the word, but i might forget too. Thank you for taking ur time to read my struggle.


My mom has always been there for me, but we moved away from her ex bf who used to be super abu$ive and controlling. He used to keep me away from food and lock me away in my room, alarms and taking everything from me, my mom followed in his footsteps, agreeing with him, screwing the door to all my bedding and clothes away in a different room. When i tried to eat, i was punished. This was mostly during summers about 2016, maybe 2018, I don‚Äôt remember. I‚Äôm still young now and almost out of high school so it‚Äôs been a while. But my mom finally saw how bad she was and how bad her ex bf was so she left after he hit her for the last and final time with me and we were homeless for a little. We went back and grabbed our stuff and left, now I live right next to my boyfriends moms house and in an apartment, and my mom has a new boyfriend and I‚Äôm close to my school.

But ever since we moved here into this apartment, I have felt depressed, I‚Äôve felt su!c!d@l, I almost checked myself into a mental hospital bc I felt so depressed. My mom is never home, she works at a train company so her jobs in the morning but she‚Äôs never home at night. She‚Äôs at her boyfriends or out drinking. I‚Äôve been basically living on my own, I pay my own phone bill, I buy groceries every money most of the time and I clean the house. I‚Äôve basically been a maid for my mom and I don‚Äôt feel like a daughter to her anymore and more like a Roommate. She‚Äôs been getting more aggressive and has been treating me like shit and her excuse it ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have rights bc I‚Äôm still young and I can‚Äôt vote‚Äù, so I sit quietly. I make our food, I take the trash out, I make sure all the almost expired food in the fridge is eaten and she calls me a ‚Äúbrat, entitled‚Äù she says to me all the time ‚ÄúI wish I would have raised you sheltered so you weren‚Äôt so liberal.‚Äù I work about 20 hours a week to keep up with our apartment, I go to school and i try to study and learn and focus but yk 4 hours almost every night at my job and then 6 hours of sleep just to wake up at 5:30 am after going to bed at like 11;30 pm bc of work doesn‚Äôt help my grades. 

About me being su!c!d@l, I do SH and I take THC to help with the pain and I like I have a good relationship with my boyfriend but I SH when I‚Äôm overwhelmed/panicked it‚Äôs a bad bad habit. But it‚Äôs been getting better. Last night as I‚Äôm writing this, I didn‚Äôt eat anything really and I passed out after trying and thr0w!ng up my food and my boyfriend found me and tried to help me and I cried and cried about my stomach hurting, my mom, school, work. Today my thighs and arms and stomach still hurt, I cut my hair off a lot and my mom yelled at me but it‚Äôs better then yk hurting myself to much. But now I feel bad, like I wanna cry and sit in the warmth of my boyfriend, I almost just want to take a much of meds and wake up in a hospital, away from stress of school and work and home. Sometimes I don‚Äôt want to wake up, I want to just fall into a deep less sleep of nothing and maybe go onto another life. Crying as I write this but it‚Äôs true, my boyfriend is so good to me but I feel like I‚Äôm not enough for him and there‚Äôs so many other reasons why I‚Äôm fucked up and I want to die but also so many why I want to live. 

I just want to ask, should I do something about my mom? My dad doesn‚Äôt live in the US anymore and so I can‚Äôt go to him for living. 

I also want to ask, is there any good ways of getting help without a mental hospital or anyways I could help myself other then buying stuff/impulse buying or SH or anything from being su!c!d@l? 

One last thing, should I tell my boyfriend? He helps a lot and last time I got to stay at his dads for a day but that was a one time thing so idk.

I have this unwavering feeling of guilt that I screwed up my kids‚Äô lives by getting a divorce and not being there for them 100% of the time. I fought for four years to get 50% custody. In California, they see a dad trying to get custody as someone who does not want to pay child support and they make it very difficult to get any kind of custody if the other parent is adamant about not giving it to you.  I have struggled with depression as far back as I can remember. I was bullied in school for being ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù because I come from an immigrant family who did not have a lot of money and I was not the best looking and no girl was ever interested in me some of which made it a point to tell me I was ugly or gross. I was sexually abused as a child. I truly think the only reason I have not killed myself is because of my kids if I didn‚Äôt have them, I would have zero reason to live. I have a great job make almost 200,000 a year, but that does not fill the void and never will. My depression and anxiety will get the best of me and cause problems between my wife and I. I let everything get to me in my mind just goes down a rabbit hole. I struggle to speak with her because there is a lot she is not sympathetic about and financially it‚Äôs a little hard because she spends a lot of money and when I try to bring it up, it turns into a fight. On the surface I‚Äôm put together but inside I am an absolute mess and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I travel for work so I spend a lot of time in hotel rooms by myself and it absolutely sucks. I really want to find ways to just stimulate my mind and be happier. I really do just want to be happier, but I can‚Äôt ever get there.  When I am alone in my hotel rooms, I cry myself to sleep almost every night. I know all of this seems so selfish because I make good money. I have a beautiful family and a beautiful house. I‚Äôm just lost.

1jhoxvl,2025-03-23T03:14:28,"Do you think the saying ""Love yourself before you look for love"" is right?
I'm mentally ,physically and overall very unhealthy, I'm suicidal and depressed and are being medicated. All of the mental health professionals I've met insist on trying to make some friends, obviously we're doing the whole love yourself thing, which has helped, I do respect my body and emotions more, but it's not enough,I still don't really ""love"" myself, I keep thinking that is the goal I have to reach, but I have no drive for it, no motivation.

Lately there has been a bit of a drive, and Im feeling guilty about it, I feel like it not the proper ""motivation"" and will just lead to more disaster.

Like being motivated to stay alive to gamble more, something like that. A good intent but a bad motivation.

There's been a girl in class around my age and *I think* she has an interest in me, emphasis on think, because as a chronically lonely, virgin, it could just be my mind obsessing over someone who has just paid a bit of attention to me, like they would on anyone, and I'm just obsessing over it and being delusional. 

And I'm constantly thinking, if this is true, is it even possible? How could she be attracted to my fatass? I'm a total loser, and telling her about my mental illness would just weird her out wouldn't it? And other questions, like do I genuinely like her or is this just blind love?(reference to previous paragraph)

My mind keeps trying to find excuses to not attempt anything with her, I keep finding imperfections on her, I keep looking at myself in the mirror thinking ""no way..."" , I just obsess over everything, I even think we're not compatible at all, I think I'm just so weird and have such weird interests and humor that noone can ever like me, especially her

Or perhaps love truly is unconditional and I can lover her for who she is and vise versa, but I feel like I can't personally love unconditionally, I feel like an asshole, I also have a porn addiction so my standards have been demolished of what a woman has to look like, I feel sick

But perhaps, this could be the key to improving? This could be the motivation that finally gets me out of this mental health hellhole? Having someone to love? Perhaps I should stop thinking about it so much and just try and do it? Just try, doesn't mean fully commiting, just go out a few times and see how things go? But I'm just too scared. Perhaps I should try making friends first before going near a woman, or perhaps this is gonna be like a book's love story, of a loser finally shining bright from finding love, but that's not how life works i assume ",think saying love look love right im mentally physically overall unhealthy im suicidal depressed medicated mental health professionals ive met insist trying make friends obviously whole love thing helped respect body emotions enoughi still dont really love keep thinking goal reach drive motivation lately bit drive im feeling guilty feel like proper motivation lead disaster like motivated stay alive gamble something like good intent bad motivation theres girl class around age think interest emphasis think chronically lonely virgin could mind obsessing someone paid bit attention like would anyone im obsessing delusional im constantly thinking true even possible could attracted fatass im total loser telling mental illness would weird wouldnt questions like genuinely like blind lovereference previous paragraph mind keeps trying find excuses attempt anything keep finding imperfections keep looking mirror thinking way obsess everything even think compatible think im weird weird interests humor noone ever like especially perhaps love truly unconditional lover vise versa feel like cant personally love unconditionally feel like asshole also porn addiction standards demolished woman look like feel sick perhaps could key improving could motivation finally gets mental health hellhole someone love perhaps stop thinking much try try doesnt mean fully commiting go times see things go im scared perhaps try making friends first going near woman perhaps gonna like books love story loser finally shining bright finding love thats life works assume,1,0,0,Neutral,Low,[],[]
1jhoq12,2025-03-23T03:02:24,"Need help in supporting a friend through mental health struggle
Need advice in helping a friend who's been struggling mentally.
A little background on him:   studying in 12th science suffering from low/negative self worth, regrets, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, self doubt, hopelessness, academic stress/pressure etc. (None of these conditions are officially diagnosed)

#An outline of what has caused his suicidal thoughts recently:
He took a decision a while ago and couldn't stick to it and is about to face/facing the consequences which has led to his suicidal thoughts. As for now, I've taken necessary steps to ensure his well being for the next 2-3 months but I don't know how to help him anymore besides professional help.
P.S: I've always tried my best to help him and never invalidated his feelings.

#The full story:
A couple of months ago he decided to skip his college (high school) mock exam as it would give him enough time to prepare for the final exam which actually mattered and he believed that he could ace it. His parents weren't supportive of his decision initially but came around later (he gave them his word that he'd ace the exam). During phase-1 of the final exam, we had to present something in front of our class for a subject. Now he had mentioned his social anxiety before but he never really seemed that socially anxious to me or to anyone else. But his social anxiety acted up which made him take the first step towards ending his life, fortunately he was kinda caught (not during the act) and we made some arrangement with our teacher that gave him an alternative to the presentation thingy.
During phase-2 of the exam (the written exam), he fucked up real bad. He forgot a lot of things he had studied, lost confidence in himself and what not. Now he says he'd either fail or barely pass the exam. He's afraid to tell his parents about the final exam. He's registered for an entrance exam scheduled for the next month and hasn't been able to start studying yet because of a little procrastination but mostly because of demotivation and he feels like absolute shit. He doesn't value himself as a person worthwhile of life anymore (this isn't new and basically he considers himself nothing but just a failur). So he believes that he's gonna fuck up in the entrance exam as well and even if he performs well, it'll be in vain as he's almost certain that he's gonna fail the final exam held last month (entrance exam score is dependent on the final exam score).

#My advice:
I've advised him to open up to his parents about everything because who knows maybe they might consult a psychologist. He's reluctant to seek professional help because he can't afford it on his own and doesn't want to involve his parents as he thinks they'll consider him to be weak for needing professional help.

#His options (acc. To him)
Now according to him he has two options (the latter being the best in his opinion):
1: Open upto his parents sooner or latter (because the discussion is inevitable as he will have to discuss with them ultimately when the results are out) and then take a drop year which involves pressure from literally everywhere: self+parents+family+the fact that he's wasted a year and failed once+expensive. 
2: End everything before the results are out. According to him, this is the best option as it is the ultimate solution to all of his problems.

Now honestly, I don't wanna lose a great friend like him.  Just a little information about him, he values mental health more than anyone else I know, but is still a little biased about professional help (a little orthodox mindset about professional help ig). Even I'm living with the burden of not having called his parents yet and told them everything which I think would make things worse or weird idk. I could call his parents and tell them everything even if it costs me our friendship because honestly it's way better than regretting having done nothing later.
As for taking a drop year, he's afraid of facing everything once again and is certain the he'll fail once again. He has a very pessimistic mindset and negative views about himself. And looking on the positive side, if he does make it even in a top institution, with or without a drop year, he's afraid of the things he'll have to face in future like socializing+communication+building confidence (he's very underconfident right now). 
P.S: he never really shows whatever he's going through. Always plays dumb or immature or happy/neutral. And he's never had a well/healthy relationship with his parents either so the fact that opening up to his parents is difficult is understandable.

Now my question for you guys is what should he do without feeling more crappy than he already is? Or what can I do for him to ease his sufferings?
Imo, the biggest challenge in front of him that could make things a little easier is opening upto his parents.",need help supporting friend mental health struggle need advice helping friend whos struggling mentally little background studying 12th science suffering lownegative self worth regrets anxiety depression suicidal ideation self doubt hopelessness academic stresspressure etc none conditions officially diagnosed outline caused suicidal thoughts recently took decision ago couldnt stick facefacing consequences led suicidal thoughts ive taken necessary steps ensure well next 23 months dont know help anymore besides professional help ps ive always tried best help never invalidated feelings full story couple months ago decided skip college high school mock exam would give enough time prepare final exam actually mattered believed could ace parents werent supportive decision initially came around later gave word hed ace exam phase1 final exam present something front class subject mentioned social anxiety never really seemed socially anxious anyone else social anxiety acted made take first step towards ending life fortunately kinda caught act made arrangement teacher gave alternative presentation thingy phase2 exam written exam fucked real bad forgot lot things studied lost confidence says hed either fail barely pass exam hes afraid tell parents final exam hes registered entrance exam scheduled next month hasnt able start studying yet little procrastination mostly demotivation feels like absolute shit doesnt value person worthwhile life anymore isnt new basically considers nothing failur believes hes gonna fuck entrance exam well even performs well itll vain hes almost certain hes gonna fail final exam held last month entrance exam score dependent final exam score advice ive advised open parents everything knows maybe might consult psychologist hes reluctant seek professional help cant afford doesnt want involve parents thinks theyll consider weak needing professional help options acc according two options latter best opinion 1 open upto parents sooner latter discussion inevitable discuss ultimately results take drop year involves pressure literally everywhere selfparentsfamilythe fact hes wasted year failed onceexpensive 2 end everything results according best option ultimate solution problems honestly dont wanna lose great friend like little information values mental health anyone else know still little biased professional help little orthodox mindset professional help ig even im living burden called parents yet told everything think would make things worse weird idk could call parents tell everything even costs friendship honestly way better regretting done nothing later taking drop year hes afraid facing everything certain hell fail pessimistic mindset negative views looking positive side make even top institution without drop year hes afraid things hell face future like socializingcommunicationbuilding confidence hes underconfident right ps never really shows whatever hes going always plays dumb immature happyneutral hes never wellhealthy relationship parents either fact opening parents difficult understandable question guys without feeling crappy already ease sufferings imo biggest challenge front could make things little easier opening upto parents,1,0,0,Neutral,Low,[],[]

Hey. I'm a teenager (16-18; not comfortable saying my actual age), M, in a pretty stressful situation. For years now, my mental health has been declining immensely. I was sexually abused for 2 years between the ages of 9 and 11, and while my abuser is behind bars now, the aftermath of what he did to me practically broke me. I've never been the same. I've developed a couple of disorders over the years such as BPD. My BPD has led me to spiral out and act in ways that I've hated myself for, but I also can't blame my behavior entirely on a disorder. I am not a good person. I'm a sociopath despite also having empathetic traits, I'm a compulsive liar, and something of a narcissist even while I hate my own guts. To make matters worse I'm a shut-in. I have 1 friend irl and we aren't very close. My previous few friendships have ended bitterly, and I rarely leave the house due to my fear of being perceived at all. The only friend I really have (that isn't online) is my mom. And she can never truly understand the depths of what I go through. My mental state has been declining rapidly for months, well, really it's been years, but it's really been noticeable within the last, I'd say nine months. I was in a relationship for about a year, with a girl who I'll call A, but a couple months ago we cut things short. We were fwb for about a week, but that's over now too, because I have continously let A down and shown her that I'm not a good person, unintentionally, but it still happened. She doesn't love me anymore and says she doesn't see herself ever loving me again. I know a lot of you will probably go ""just drop her, she's not that important,"" but that isn't the case for me.

Does anyone else, when you feel really hopeless (not to be confused with just sadness but specifically hopeless), have the middle of their palms ache? For me it is moreso in the right hand.

1jhs96u,2025-03-23T06:32:05,"Gee thanks! I never thought of just 'thinking of something else' when I'm stressed
I've been living in a foreign country for 16 years now. I've been in the house I'm in now for 5 years. The past few months have been hell. After years of no issues, suddenly my landlord has issues with everything I do ... the same things I've done since I moved in... She is now trying to make me pay for repairs that are her responsibility (tiles on the balcony, wood frames on exterior windows) by saying that it's my fault -not the tropical sun and rain - that they need repairing. She expects me to pay for them. She told me that I am supposed to pay for the repairs when they were halfway done.... As in she said the tiles need replacing, I agreed, she sent a repairman, then once he finished half the work she goes 'oh ya, you're paying for this.' I contacted a lawyer and she says the best course of action is for me to GTFO asap. It is hard to rent a place here as a foreigner and there aren't a lot of places for rent to begin with. This has shot my anxiety up to 11. The lawyer wants me to avoid talking to the landlord (which is my first choice too) but the landlord keeps texting and each time my phone lights up my heart races and I start physically shaking. I just muted her number for now as I'm typing this because she just (it's 1130pm) another message asking to come over tomorrow so we can talk.... So her number's muted but now I'm super anxious wondering if she's sent anything else.  

So I'm trying to find a place as fast as possible, so far I have 1 option but it's horrible and super far from anything which would completely change how I live my day to day life but right now it's literally my only option. Then I'm also starting to pack and clean all my shit. And I'm teaching online every day. 

After I saw the place today I came back home and cried, like sobbing, shaking crying and I couldn't stop. I could not catch my breath. I messaged the 2 people who I know in town (another foreigner and my cleaning lady) to help me and they're both amazing and trying but both of them said 'don't stress, just stop thinking about it' and it's like that phrase made it worse. Like gee thanks, never thought of that before. I literally can't stop thinking about it, nothing is distracting me, I can't read, crochet, watch anything at all, eat, or sleep. I'm insanely overwhelmed, I need to start packing but I have no idea where to start. I'm on my own until Monday when my cleaning lady is coming to help me clean/pack and rental offices are open. So I'm stuck in a loop til Monday. 

My mom suggested going to a pharmacy and buying some kind of sleeping aid or a night time formula of something just so I can fall asleep but that would mean going out in public and at the moment that's not an option.

So ya, I'm an absolute mess, in a foreign country, stuck in limbo until at least monday. It's fucking great.

1jhkele,2025-03-22T23:26:23,"Im obsessed with kurt cobain and i dont know what to do
sorry if this is formatted poorly or dosent make sense, im not in the best state right now and im on a new medication that makes me feel weird and believe odd things and im still getting used to it (to clarify this is not from the medication, as my infatuation with him started much before i started the medication) I 15F have an extensive history of mental health issues and trauma that ranges back to elementary school so this isnt that horrifying to come to terms with. I've been into grunge music for a decent amount of time, almost 2 years, however it was mostly the band hole and occasionally a few other artists. I never really had an interest in nirvana because it was really annoying that whenever i brought up that i liked hole and courtney love, my parents and others alive to experience the grunge scene always started schizophrenicly rambling about how courtney love is a heartless monster that murdered kurt cobain. My only experience with nirvana back then was hearing smells like teen spirit on the radio which i never really liked. However a couple months ago i decided to see what all the hype was about. I started listening to his songs more and more which  lead to me consuming more media surrounding nirvana, interviews with the band, videos of live shows, clips of him, etc. it was all pretty normal fan behavior. Then i saw the pictures. i think this is really when everything culminated and went downhill. Im autistic and ive had debilitating depression and anxiety as long as i can remember, ive just learned to live with it. i have a slight drug problem. it all kinda started when a little while ago, i wont talk abt what i took bc of rules but i ended up throwing up most of it before it could absorb into my blood. I think i only really got like a third of the actual dosages i took. anyway, in my totally fucked up state, i somehow ended up on youtube on my phone (i dont remember much past this and throwing up) and i ended up on a video of the images of kurt cobain's body that were released by the police in 2016. it changed me. this isnt the first time ive seen death, the images dont even show anything past his shoes and his hand and ive seen much more disturbing images and videos. but this sat with me. after i woke up and somehow collected myself the next morning i went back to the video. i cant stop watching it. i cant look away. this lead me down a rabbit hole into his suicide. i obsessively read his suicide note, look at the images, look at evidence, listen to the last song he played where he talks about shooting himself, watched interviews with courtney after his death, watched clips of him, wrote him letters. we are so similar, he talked about how nobody ever understood him and the world saw him as something he wasnt, i feel the exact same way. he talks about how he feels hes too sensitive like i do. we both use drugs to escape, i could go on and on about everything we have in common and everything amazing about him. hes like everything i am and everything i wish i could be at the same time. my entire life ive felt othered by everybody and its the first time ive ever seen anybody who feels the same way i do. i delusionally think that im the only one who understands him or that he can hear or see me somehow. i know this is silly and its not real. **i dont get any type of pleasure or satisfaction from watching this, i dont relish in his suffering and i really hope it dosent come across this way** whenever i go back to his music or the note or the pictures its extremely upsetting for me and i get extremely depressed, but i keep going back. i think i want some sort of comfort or closure or answer from these things that i never get. instead i always leave with the same lingering conclusion: **if somebody so similar to me, yet so beloved, someone that brought so much light to the world and so many people like me, someone that seemed like he had everybody rooting for him, still cant win, still suffer so much he cant bare to keep going, whats the point of me trying at all..? he was so great, so good and so beautiful inside and out. im nothing like him in that way. why should i even try? whats the point of staying alive.** im probably not going to kill myself. i never knew him but it feels like i do, i disgust myself. i grieve someone that never knew me. yet i feel like he can see me and i can see him. beyond death. no he dosent talk to me im not that fucking crazy. dont tell me im just immature and its some small crush on him, i dont even really like him that way, he was just so beautiful in every way like nobody ive ever seen before. im not some stupid kid that just sees someone they relate to for the first time. its so much more than that. i see him like nobody else did. im aware this is unhealthy and its not normal and its not the first time ive had delusions about things, when i was younger i thought the government had cameras in my computer and in my smoke detector. i used to hallucinate fairly frequently but it has mostly subsided for about a year. ive been hospitalized for it, i literally had to be at the absolute brink and go completely off the handle, ignoring school and my physical needs for it and still nobody took me seriously. i literally had screaming fits when i was in middle school where i just cried and cried and screamed and screamed if anybody got close to my room because i thought they were trying to hurt me. my parents handled this horribly and thought if they just screamed back that id be fixed. that worked as well as you could imagine. at the psych ward they told me it was anxiety and tried to give me some shitty ssris even though ive tried about every ssri and snri on the market and nothing has worked. i dont get them, maybe they think im a med seeker because i wasnt acting like an animal when i was in the hospital and around the doctors and nurses. anyway, kurt, i cant stop thinking about him, ive tried and tried, i stopped looking at the pictures and the note and listening to his music but i cant stop thinking about him. i dont know if im more obsessed with him or his death. i know its disgusting, but like i said i get no pleasure from thinking of his death. i think its a combination of some bizzare coping mechanism and desperately looking for closure and comfort. im not sure for what. that he didnt suffer? that hes not suffering anymore wherever he is in the afterlife? that it never happened? that its all fake and hes ok somewhere far away? that it really happened and its over? that if i do this i wont suffer anymore? maybe its everything. i cant grasp it, i never can. i never came to terms with it after my cousin molested me, i could probably never come to terms with something like this. i think im
looking for confirmation and closure that hes really gone but hes ok now because hes not in pain anymore. everybody else ignores me, i have barely any friends, ive spent my birthday alone or with my parents for the past 4 years. my boyfriend, 22m barely ever fucking talks to me, hes really sweet when he does but theres this constant lingering feeling like he just dosent care. hes in college and really busy so idk what to feel. dont even mention the age gap, thats not what im here to talk about and whatever your about to say about it i already know and have heard a thousand times before. ig it dosent matter bc i think about him about 100x less than i do kurt. he just dosent get me like he would. but im desprate for any affection, i stopped initiating it from my parents years ago. its not their fault, they have been through it all like me, and they love me as much as they are capable of, they are just as sick as me, but its almost worse because instead of constantly evolving and morphing, for better or for worse, like i do, they are completely stuck in their own ways. never changing, never getting worse but never getting better, well thats not completely true. with meditation my mom has gotten better over the years. my mom has bi polar disorder which heavily effected me as a child. i was stuck with her for the majority of it because my dad was in jail for beating her infront of me for most of it. he has npd and can never be wrong. ex con, multiple felon, drug charges, breaking and entering, violent crimes, the whole nine yards. he ""turned his life around"" and now makes a bunch of money hes racist now and has been clean for years but honestly id still take being stuck in that little warehouse with no bathroom door, a single matress and no furniture, malnourished and miserable while my mom tormented me as much as she loved me, a hundred times before id spend my childhood with my father. if i did id have probably killed myself way before id make it to this point. i still love both of them, i cant really fully blame them in a lot of ways they were sicker than i am. i dont know what to do with myself. i cant tell them. i cant ask for help, theyll put me back in the psych ward, treat me like an animal  and wont even help me. ill fail school if i go back. im already behind with a referall for not showing up to school because of my current state. the pills they gave me do nothing but make me worse. i need sedatives. i dont even want them to abuse them. i just want to feel ok. i genuinely get fits of anxiety so bad i cant sleep, cant move, cant talk, cant breathe. and they wont give me anything but fucking ssris that wont do anything. nothing works. a small amount of weed works but of theyd never give that to me for obvious reasons. i feel so stuck. i dont know what to do. this feels like the end but ive said that a hundred times before. they made me leave my best friend, it was probably for the best because that school environment degraded my health like acid eating through wood floors. but she was the only person who understood me even a fraction of what kurt cobain would. i feel like i cant live without her, and i guess im
not. i just hope i wake up and this was just a delusion from the meds, that im not really as sick as i am and that these new meds are just making me paranoid of something thats not real.

We (FF/49&45) have been together for 11 years, 8 of them married. We‚Äôve been through lots of ups & downs life wise but never really relationship wise, we never had a reason to fight or argue, we calmly discussed our problems. We always got along wonderfully, we never stopped going on dates, writing each other sweet notes, chores are ~50/50 depending on who has more time & energy. 
About a 1 ago we started arguing every now & then but it resolved quickly until the arguments repeated again & again,we never really resolved the cause.. mostly issues with jealousy, being afraid I‚Äôll leave her for someone else. Starting with her suddenly getting jealous & seeing everyone I‚Äôm close with as trying to get between us, no reason behind it apparently, on the way to a dinner party we argued & when we arrived I went to another friend & left her to go alone, I realize I should‚Äôve handled this more calmly & I apologized for getting louder & leaving, since then it‚Äôs not really the same anymore, I don‚Äôt know if she got scared or anything, she knows Im not violent, I didn‚Äôt scream at her, I know she hates that, but I think she sees small issues as an argument already& getting upset as getting angry.  

She has a history of abusive relationships,went no contact with most family, she was diagnosed with cptsd/gad, battled addiction , suicidal thoughts,all before we met. It was never a problem for our relationship in my eyes, she was always more or less worried it would affect our relationship. Jealousy might have something to do w/ her body dismorphia which I think has been around since the jealousy started. She jumped from one diet to another from time to time. 
When I ask her what‚Äôs wrong she either says nothing‚Äô ‚ÄòI‚Äôm just not feeling well‚Äô ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt wanna talk about it‚Äô when I ask her friends they say they don‚Äôt know, maybe a depressive episode which has happened in the past: she stopped talking to me told me it‚Äôs nothing, until a nervous breakdown, I supported her through therapy and everything seemed to be going well, after that we got married, bout two years in a similar episode, but resolved quickly. 

We barely talk sometimes, if we do we argue. Few days we actually act like a couple, I try not to ruin those moments by not mentioning anything about these issues.
I usually do her hair/nails, she asks me to do it, we make put a time, but then tells me she doesn‚Äôt feel like it anymore, I make breakfast, plan dates, try to talk to her, nothing from her side, she barely eats some days, she goes to bed at 7pm sometimes and spending much more time in bed.. I have no idea how to save our relationship. I think she thinks  I already decided for myself I‚Äôm gonna divorce anyway & there‚Äôs no point in doing anything about it. I‚Äôm willing to go to any therapy she wants, I suggested couples therapy she said ‚Äòyou don‚Äôt believe in that anyway‚Äô I said that in the very beginning to a friend, idk how she even remembers that. She said ‚Äòyou‚Äôll leave me anyways‚Äô 

When I asked her best friend she said ‚Äòmaybe a depressive episode, please stay with her‚Äô  (To her friends she seems quite normal, despite being more depressed, she talks to them laughs w/ them, they go out together. ) What if it‚Äôs worse than that, last time it was her mom passing away, I would know if someone else passed away, what if it‚Äôs a bad diagnosis? Or hers?

It bothered her that I work longer or stay in the car for a while, when she told me that I came home early the whole week but we barely talked & spend the rest of the day in different rooms, following week I worked longer again she complained I don‚Äôt wanna come home to her, I told her whats the point if she ignores me, she said nothing & left. Half my friends are apparently flirting with me and wanting to date me, one she even titled as a competition to her. 

For everyone suspecting she cheated, I‚Äôd put my hand in fire, she‚Äôs the most loyal person I know.   I want to help her but I can‚Äôt if she doesn‚Äôt want any help or can‚Äôt even tell me what‚Äôs wrong..
How do I talk to her..

Big big trigger warning for SH and hallucinations

So I've been in therapy for over half of my life (I'm 20) and I feel like I've gotten nowhere. I do understand that due to trauma, I have been masking a majority of my life. Autism was what started the masking habit but since I'm away from my abusers and am now in a stable place everything is falling apart. I've had a diagnosed ""anxiety disorder"" since I was 12 but it's gotten so much worse. I feel I've developed agoraphobia with how bad it is for me to even think about leaving my home. I get rushed with all of the things that can go wrong. It genuinely feels like if I leave, I'll die. I go into panic mode almost immediately. I won't leave unless absolutely necessary and even then it's insanely difficult.

 I've also noticed a habit of passively hurting myself. I'll hit my knees, purposefully run into things, even scratching my hands and neck to the point of bleeding. I think it's an anxiety thing but it's genuinely out of control. Sometimes these things are joined by intrusive thoughts of causing harm to myself. For example, if I'm doing the dishes and I see knives I have to walk away and stop myself from purposefully fileting my hands. Or stabbing myself. Wanting to throw myself infront of cars. Even trying to drown myself once on purpose. It's gotten harder and harder to stop these urges and I'm genuinely scared. I don't want to die and I don't want to hurt myself.

On top of that I just don't feel real. I think part of those urges is the need to feel something. Like assure myself that I am real. I feel like I'm operating a mech suit that I have no control over most of the time. It doesn't help when I see figures in the corner of my eyes and calling my name. Sometimes it's more than that. The hallucinations are what scare me the most because this makes it so difficult to be up front with my therapist. I've tried so hard to talk about these things with her but my body shuts down. It's like my brain is screaming for help but my body says no. I am my own enemy.

I've only ever been misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 14 as a placeholder diagnosis. The only solid things on my chart are anxiety and depression. How can I bring this up with my therapist? What might be causing these feelings and urges? What avenues of research should I look in to? Please anything will be helpful. I'm only able to get this out because I'm copy/pasting this from a Google doc and not actually speaking.

I struggle since almost 5 years. My dad is horrible, my mom messes with my mind and I dont know what to think of her anymore. Both of them ruined me. 

I went to therapist in january, I realized I cant handle it all on my own and Im just too tired.

 Like a week ago I accidently told them in an argument that I wanna die and they reacted poorly. They yelled and threathened with adoption and mental hospital. Also said that ""I have no reason to feel this way"" and ""they didnt raise me like this."" I didnt tell my therapist about my suicidal thoughts and SH cause Im scared shes gonna tell them and Im scared of their reaction. But theyre gonna see my SH scars in the summer. I went too deep and theyre not gonna fade soon or even ever. I dont want them to know.

Yesterday they wanted to talk with me. Turns out my mom read last page of my diary. I planned suicide and talked about it a bit there, that Im done and cant do this anymore etc. Im still trembling and my stomach hurts since she told me this. I cant believe she invaded my privacy like this. She also called my therapist to tell her this. I have a session in 3 days and she definitely will mention it.

 I dont know what to do. Really. I just want to die more now, I feel so helpless. The closest psychward is 40 mins from me, and the opinions on the website are scaring me. I dont think I wanna go there. Idk if theres any other option. I wish I could just die, really. But now they know, Im scared to do anything. And Im scared they will invade my privacy again.

I'm not sure what it is, but I'm conflicted between the word depressed and lazy. I don't know if I'm overexaggerating and sadly I have to express this on a reddit post since it's easier than expressing it to a person face to face. For many years, I've felt unmotivated to complete my school assignments. I WANT to do good, but I just feel a sense of hopelessness and also don't find a point in doing anything anymore. I also am upset/feeling down majority of the day, feel lonely, and basically just want to sit in one place for the whole day.

Anyone else just feel completely lost all the time? Like there's some kind of solution to everything that you haven't found? A key to all of this? I realize there's probably no such thing, I know some people eventually end up becoming spiritual or finding god or something like that but I'm really not like that, so perhaps I need to adapt to the saying ""there is no purpose"" and try to adapt to that, I agree with it despite not feeling very comfortable with it 

I guess for me, if someone asked me the purpose is living a life without regrets and guilt, I know that no matter who you are,no matter what you've done in life, how successful you are, how rich etc, in our deathbed we're gonna gave regrets and guilt, my goal is to reduce those as much as possible, knowing how painful death is, my goal is to make it less painful.

A little info about me, I am 19 , I have chronic pain, I have been diagnosed with depression, a non specificied personality disorder, I have no degree, no job, nothing 

I have hobbies, I'm not extremely passionate about anything really, never have been, I wouldn't want to do any of my hobbies as a job, so everything seems like a dead end in my life and how I'm seeing things

I am a virgin, I have never fallen in love or been in a relationship, I am a porn addict, I am fat, and constantly suicidal.

I'm the definition of a loser, I don't mind, I'm just being realistic, I like being realistic even if it hurts.

What's not realistic, for me at least, is finding a job that will torment me physically and mentally, something I don't care about at all, just to say "" I have a job"" to people and live a basic normal life, have a family and all that typical bs. I get many comments like this, telling me to just go out, find a woman, have sex, get a job, get money, go on with life, to me that's just ignorance, what my whole family tree has been doing, and what comes out of it eventually, pain, guilt, regret.

Advice?

Trigger warnings
S*icidal thoughts, ptsd, d*m*st*c v**l*nc*

I do not believe my life has meaning, can anyone help? I think it‚Äôs pointless and im a waste of air.
Disclaimer i do not believe in a religion so converting or ‚Äúfinding god‚Äù unfortunately wont help me 
Some fun facts: i love nature and have a very creative mind, sometimes i replace s*lf h*rm by getting tattoos or piercings, i am struggling with my grades, i go to therapy (new development though) and have been on lexapro for over a year now

I (19f) am a freshman in college in my second semester. When i was 15 i got into a horribly abusive relationship and did not leave for 3 and a half years out of fear and due to heavy manipulation. It had left me with horrible ptsd. I have also been diagnosed with anxiety and depression since i was 8 years old. Recently i got into therapy and saw a doctor diagnosing me with autism spectrum disorder and adhd. 

I understand Im all ‚Äúyoung and spry.‚Äù But i feel like i wasted my life away. Its been years since ive had freedom and idk what to do with it. If i am without some sort of stimulation or if I am alone too long I get severe panic attacks. But when having free time i do not know what to do with it because i feel like its just too late for me.

Im not good with people, i dint have many close friends. I have a lovely boyfriend but hes social and goes out with people or does things when he wants.

1jgoynd,2025-03-21T20:15:54,"Seeking Advice on Brain Screening Tests for Paranoia, Negative Thinking, and Social Isolation
Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm reaching out for advice regarding my 32-year-old brother, who has been struggling with severe negative thoughts, paranoia, compulsive lying, extreme jealousy and holding grudges for over 12 years.¬† His behaviour has seemed to worsen over the years. When he talks, he appears very delusional and out of touch with reality, and usually is hating on others - friends, family. He stays in this zone constantly. He refuses to acknowledge that anything is wrong and doesn‚Äôt understand how deeply his actions are affecting those around him, particularly my parents.¬†

He lacks good friends, hobbies, passions, a sense of responsibility, or personal growth, and has no meaningful relationships. His expectations from others and life are often unrealistic. He tends to take rather than give, believing that my father, mother, and I dislike him and don‚Äôt want him to succeed, and that no one is on his side. He feels as if the entire world is against him. His mind constantly feeds him these distorted stories, and it‚Äôs challenging to change his perspective. He spends all day in his room, isolating himself. He recently had a heart attack (he‚Äôs just 32), which we think might be linked to his long-term marijuana (or even hard drugs) use over the past decade.

We‚Äôve been very patient with him, just listening to him without challenging his views because if we try to explain that his thinking is skewed, he becomes very angry. He also continues to insist that he has no mental health issues and that everything is fine. As a family, we are blessed to have each other, and despite everything, my brother is a beautiful human being and has a lot of potential. He‚Äôs just a victim of his own mind, and his thoughts and fears overpower him. We desperately want to help him break free from this cycle.

Given these concerns, I‚Äôm looking into potential brain screening tests to help identify any neurological or physical causes for his behaviour, any potential mental disorder. I‚Äôm especially interested in tests that don‚Äôt require him to verbally engage with his thoughts or emotions, as he‚Äôs extremely resistant to talking about his mental health. Is there any such test available?¬†

If anyone has experience with similar situations, or can recommend which tests might be most useful in this case, I would really appreciate your advice. Additionally, if you have any suggestions on how to bring positive change into his life or support him in breaking the negative thought patterns, it would be incredibly helpful.¬†

Thank you so much for your support and any insights you can offer. Never giving up on him or losing hope.

I have a long-time friend whom I deeply cherish. In a short time, we became confidants, soul siblings. But I feel like things might change.

She once attempted suicide, but her little dog walked into the room at that very moment and stopped her. She has been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a while, and I‚Äôve always tried to be there, to help in any way I could. But lately, I feel more and more like I‚Äôm running out of options. I know I‚Äôve helped her a lot during these times, but it feels like nothing I do is ever enough. And it‚Äôs horrible‚Äîto feel this powerless while watching someone so important to me slowly disappear before my eyes. It‚Äôs almost like grieving someone who is still alive.

Lately, she‚Äôs been in therapy and taking medication for depression, but it doesn‚Äôt seem like anything is changing. Even when she says she‚Äôs fine, it feels like everything could fall apart at any moment. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve been on high alert for so long that even the slightest sign from her sends me into a panic. Over the past few weeks, she has been distancing herself, which has terrified me. In her darkest moments, I was there for her‚Äîbut what if she has a relapse while she‚Äôs away? How can I be there if she doesn‚Äôt want me there?

While we‚Äôre not in contact, my body reacts as if I‚Äôm one step away from receiving the news that she has finally gone through with what she‚Äôs been planning for so long. And that possibility destroys me.

But it‚Äôs unbearable to live every day feeling like I‚Äôm constantly on the edge, watching my world crumble in front of me and being unable to do anything. There were moments of such desperation that, in my madness, I even thought it would be easier if she had already done it‚Äîbecause at least then I would be free from this constant fear.

Hi, 20M here studying at university in the UK. 

I‚Äôve found university to be one of the loneliest and most depressing periods of my life so far. As a kid you always hear how at university you‚Äôll make friends for life and meet countless people‚Ä¶ but my experience has been nothing like that. 

I get really socially anxious around people I don‚Äôt know and literally don‚Äôt know how to socialise with anyone who isn‚Äôt already a close friend, overthinking every little interaction. I‚Äôve tried going out of my comfort zone by joining the American Football team in the university for a year but found it hard to find anything more than really shallow friendships, and have since been injured so can‚Äôt train or go to any socials and I‚Äôm scared to back after recovery‚Ä¶ not sure why, it‚Äôs a completely irrational fear. 

8 or so months ago my partner ended a two year relationship‚Ä¶ the way she did really hurt me and in all honesty I‚Äôm still not over it and it‚Äôs left me wanting to avoid dating entirely out of fear of losing anyone I do come close with. She was essentially the only thing keeping me together whilst at university and now that she‚Äôs gone I‚Äôm finding every day to be a massive struggle. Either binge eating or not eating at all, finding tasks like keeping ontop of laundry or keeping my room tidy to be monumental, I‚Äôve even lost any motivation to do my hobbies like music, gaming, tabletop miniatures or coding. It sounds so corny but I genuinly feel empty and just like I‚Äôm living life on autopilot, floating through days of the week. 

I‚Äôve tried reaching out to school councillors but I hate sharing my feelings, especially face to face. it makes me feel weak and vulnerable. As well as the fact whenever I do I burst into tears and become incomprehensible.

C is very nice and I love being their friend. but recently they have frequently had panic attacks in the middle of class, between classes, at lunch, etc.  It's constant and I've tried asking them if they wanted to talk about it or if there is any triggers to their panic attacks and every time I ask they never want to talk about it or tell me how I can help them when they are in these situations. I feel like i'm walking on eggshells because I don't know what could be triggering to them. 

I'm very worried about my friend but at the same time, I can't stop worrying when the next panic attack will be when I'm with them.

1jh1v4a,2025-03-22T06:58:09,"I want to put my life together
Hello,

  
I'm a 24 old male and I've been depressed at least for 5 years. It has come to a point I've decided to try to finally get better - although, I've said that to myself before.

I'm currently studying my 5th year in university and I would graduate this spring. Instead, I've managed to complete a total of two courses. I have lied to my parents that I'm about to finish my bachelor's degree and I only need to get an apprentice job (or whatever it is called in English). Not only that, but I've built this web of lies how my studies are proceeding as I can't bring myself to confess to anyone - parents, relatives, friends etc. - that I haven't actually done shit. And I feel like it has only become harder to confess as the time and my lies continue.

During my second year in uni, my father appeared in my apartment on Saturday evening and found me asleep in my bed in my messy apartment. At that point I confessed I hadn't done any studies and so, he and my mom got me to see a doctor. I got a medication (not the first time btw) and went to see a psychiatrist. I got an admission note for a therapist but I never tried to get one. 

That spring, I actually managed to complete one course - all thanks to one friend from our acquaintance in the university. He sent me a message that we were put in the same group (the whole course was a group project) and asked if I was gonna attend - so I did. The second course I did consisted solely of micro exams which were quick and easy to do. That I did on my third year. After that I have tried to attend courses, I'd always sign up to a course, but never attend. Last year I almost managed to finish one course but couldn't bring myself to do all the required coursework.

Even the thought of trying to do a minor task for my studies feels like a burden. I manage to do that from time to time, but when it comes to bigger tasks (essays, big group projects, courses with a lot of work etc.) I feel overwhelmed and don't even try. Instead, I rot in my apartment, distracting myself with video games, TV series, movies, YouTube videos, porn... heck, lately I've been ordering a ton of food and gained weight thanks to that.

About medication: I've tried a total of 3 different antidepressants, first one before university, second one during my second year and third last fall. All three times I might felt a little better at first, but still wasn't able to study at all. I also stopped eating the medication cold turkey and felt nothing. I don't even know why I stopped. I guess at least this last time I kept forgetting to take my pills and I would take a double dose next day.

On top of not being able to study and constantly distracting myself, I've got other issues as well. My sleep schedule is a mess - if you can even call it that. I pretty much stay up until I feel tired enough to fall asleep easily, because when I try to sleep without feeling tired, I just can't. I don't shower or clean my apartment regularly and I barely brush my teeth. I need a complete rework on my dentals, yet I can't bring myself to brush them regularly. I haven't been able to make any new friends or get into a relationship. It has gotten to a point I don't even bother to try. 

I have all these dreams and plans of things I want to do now or at some point in life, but I can't start a single one - even when it's something I feel really excited about. My recent one is that I'd start going to gym and get in shape but so far - nothing.

Sometimes I feel like I'm not even really depressed. Like, I don't feel bad about myself per se, I just hate the position I am in my life and how it feels like there is no way out. I don't know where to start, I can't bring myself to seek help from my family or friends... like, I did try again last fall and got the medication but clearly that wasn't enough and couldn't then continue getting further help on my own.

I don't even know why I'm writing this right now. It's 8 in the morning, I haven't slept and I have to go to work in 10 minutes or so. What do I do? Where do I start?",want put life together hello im 24 old male ive depressed least 5 years come point ive decided try finally get better although ive said im currently studying 5th year university would graduate spring instead ive managed complete total two courses lied parents im finish bachelors degree need get apprentice job whatever called english ive built web lies studies proceeding cant bring confess anyone parents relatives friends etc havent actually done shit feel like become harder confess time lies continue second year uni father appeared apartment saturday evening found asleep bed messy apartment point confessed hadnt done studies mom got see doctor got medication first time btw went see psychiatrist got admission note therapist never tried get one spring actually managed complete one course thanks one friend acquaintance university sent message put group whole course group project asked gonna attend second course consisted solely micro exams quick easy third year tried attend courses id always sign course never attend last year almost managed finish one course couldnt bring required coursework even thought trying minor task studies feels like burden manage time time comes bigger tasks essays big group projects courses lot work etc feel overwhelmed dont even try instead rot apartment distracting video games tv series movies youtube videos porn heck lately ive ordering ton food gained weight thanks medication ive tried total 3 different antidepressants first one university second one second year third last fall three times might felt little better first still wasnt able study also stopped eating medication cold turkey felt nothing dont even know stopped guess least last time kept forgetting take pills would take double dose next day top able study constantly distracting ive got issues well sleep schedule mess even call pretty much stay feel tired enough fall asleep easily try sleep without feeling tired cant dont shower clean apartment regularly barely brush teeth need complete rework dentals yet cant bring brush regularly havent able make new friends get relationship gotten point dont even bother try dreams plans things want point life cant start single one even something feel really excited recent one id start going gym get shape far nothing sometimes feel like im even really depressed like dont feel bad per se hate position life feels like way dont know start cant bring seek help family friends like try last fall got medication clearly wasnt enough couldnt continue getting help dont even know im writing right 8 morning havent slept go work 10 minutes start,1,0,0,Neutral,Moderate,[],[]

1jfsj14,2025-03-20T17:11:44,"(about trauma) I need someone that helps me understand what's happening
(about trauma) Could someone help me understand what's happening?

Ps: i don't know if I chose the right tag. And I say ""trauma"" because I don't know what more to say, not because I have one defined. Also I am (at least was) gifted (like, in a neurodivergence way, so that can change how it experience trauma) 

Thanks 4 any help :)

I had like awful teenage years, specially for my parents, and highschool, and obviously without any help (including the psychologist, My parents were more clients than I was, and when that wasn't the case, they changed my psychologist). But the thing here is that I don't understand anything it's happening with me after that.

For the record, it all almost (as far as I know) ended at 17, and I think it started slowly at 12, more defined at 14, and the max was in 15-16. But I don't have at all the ""characteristics"" of a trauma. Since it ended, I don't know if it was since I was 16 or 17, my cognitive abilities have been progressively getting worse. And that's horrible, because I relied on them for everything. I could ask and receive help from my brain, and now I can't. I mean, my head and whatever my abilities reached has always been ""my home,"" and now that they're gone, they aren't. I mean, my ability to interpret, to analyze, the activity of my head in general, the ability to make decisions, to understand things, to learn, to remember, introspection, literally everything.Adding to that, my entire identity was built on reflections and introspection that without my abilities I am not capable of doing. 
Added to that were things like, at the end of 17 I suddenly started to taste blood in my mouth (without blood), which apparently it was anxiety (I had a CT scan), at 16 after a very strong anxiety attack (which I don't remember) I started hearing an engine in my ear, which went away, until now it has returned with the anxiety (cause I'm super scared of losing my skills), added to more things. It's like half my brain is shut off and everything is in half, There comes a point where it's not fog, it's just ""nothing."" My brain also has a really hard time recovering from everything, and sometimes it's like a part of it malfunctions, tingles, and blocks everything. Although I have limits even when I'm ""clear."" and I'm genuinely worried that it's physical. I'm going to see a neurologist next month. And my abilities also fluctuate, sometimes I can do something and the next day less but I can do something else, One day I can access and understand certain reflections and the next day I may not, etc. Although it doesn't happen just from day to day, sometimes it lasts for several days in a row. The point is that in one way or another it started right during the trauma or when it ended (little by little) 

But that's not the case. What I mean is that I don't have the problems that they say occur in trauma of ""guilt"", ""flashbacks"", ""nightmares"", ""negative perspective on myself"", ""a lot of dissociation"", I am not impulsive, nor unstable (not beyond anxiety), I don't overreact, I don't have triggers, I'm not emotionally dead or hyperactive either. etc. 

Just the other day I told a friend that I didn't understand how all the people who suffered from derealization hated it so much. Because in my case, when it happens to me, it just happens and it doesn't scare me. And my friend told me that in her case when she dissociated it was as if she were going to faint and leave the world (That only happened to me once, and more than dissociating, it was the opposite, and I thought I was going to die or go crazy because I was not able to sustain so much at that moment and it certainly was not my will, but not because I had dissociated). And that friend doesn't have experiences like I do. I know everyone is different, but I've been dissociating since I was a child over minor things, so I don't understand how it's possible dissociate so little in relation to what I suppose I should if I had a trauma. Like, Apparently, I don't fit into that part of ""trauma"" either.

But this is still not all. Now it turns out that my sister told me something yesterday that I didn't remember (of all things I don't remember). Apparently I often insulted her for no reason, just for things like ""she leaves the room and I insult her as much as I can as if she had done something horrible."" To begin with, I don't think she's lying. But It's not just that I don't remember, but it doesn't make any sense. Back then, I was obsessed with analyzing every one of my actions, being objective, not acting emotionally, reflecting, etc. I really tried very hard to be conscious of all my actions and do the most appropriate thing. Like, a lot. It reached a level where as a defense mechanism I developed a small mental voice beyond the one that was in charge to interpret everything objectively, to prevent my perspective from being distorted by emotions, and tell me to force me to put my feet on the ground, etc (like a kind of imaginary friend who, by the way, is no longer there, To begin with, because I don't have the analytical skills I had then, and to continue, because I'm no longer in that situation and it was a defense mechanism). I mean, I really made a lot of effort, so it doesn't make the slightest sense like, from what I remember it was then. 

I knew I didn't remember things, but I'm constantly bringing up more strange things in my memory that I don't understand:
1. My room, I don't remember anything about my room, in fact, I thought I had my room right after the trauma was over. And I even have memories of my empty room (while they were changing the bed) in the later stages of the trauma. And in fact I have memories where I thought that the trauma was over (during the changing rooms) (with the room empty)  But apparently they changed my room at the beginning of my 16th birthday, that is, during the trauma and at its peak. And from there I realized that I don't remember anything in my room other than after the trauma. 
2. I have two memories of my room during the trauma, but in the memories I am in my room from before, on the floor, and in a place that in the room where that memory happened I really couldn't have put myself, when temporarily, technically, that room no longer existed. I mean, the memory is real (I asked) but I have it in a completely different place. Those memories confused me too. 
3. I don't remember practically anything specific and especially not my day-to-day life at school. Or in home. I will remember at most 2 scenes (without dialogue) from all my psychologists in all those years, and I have had several. In fact, I have more memories at my father's house (where even I understood the experience was worse, and at first I thought that was the only reason for my bad adolescence until I started to think). (The room I don't remember is the one in my mom's house), I mean, I don't understand how I have more memories from where I had the worst time (as far as I know) if technically not remembering is a ""defense mechanism."". I'm protecting myself from the backhand or something. 
4. I also have no idea what my daily life was like in the room before mine, or at all. 
5. Then the thing about my sister, not only do I not remember it, but it doesn't fit. 

And like, more. 

The thing is that I don't understand anything, I don't fit into anything I see of traumas, what I am is what I was then at 16 but I can't even reach it because I have lost my cognitive abilities, I don't know what's physical and what's not, I don't understand my memories, and now I don't even know if the version of me that I held on to so much now with what my sister told me doesn't make sense, But I do remember all the effort I made regarding emotion and logic, that is, I don't know how to ""coordinate"" both things. Like, I literally just want to see if anyone understands anything about what I'm going through or has a similar experience, because I certainly don't.

But if I'm being honest, it made me feel a lot worse, and I just need some advice or something like that, which is why I'm talking about it here. I'm not expecting someone to diagnose me in this subreddit, nor am I expecting this to be a counselling session. I just need some advice is all! :))

I've been experiencing psychotic symptoms for the past year and a quarter, including hallucinations, fixed beliefs, disorganized speech and thought processes, and personality distortion (?). It's like my brain also makes links between things that don't make sense, and that I'm constantly on the way edge between having to manage my symptoms and not being able to. I had a difficult childhood, but none of my perceptions seem related to my hallucinations or delusions. I've processed what happened to me, and I no longer struggle with dealing with my past. However, when I visited CAMHs today, the clinician said that it's just ""a trauma response"", and that I'm ""too logical for someone facing a psychotic disorder, or any disorder at all"", which just seemed wrong. I don't want to sound like a know it all, or that I know better than an experienced clinician, but I can't help but feel that it's not a trauma response at all. My trauma response was stealing from my own house, and being deceitful, which has since dissipated, and I've not struggled with it for the past 5 or something years? 

Was she right in saying this? Does it really seem like just a trauma response? I'm happy to provide more context or background for anyone actually interested and listening to me ramble on :)) where do I even go from there? What if she's wrong?

hi, im currently a teen (16f) in highschool and last year, i found a youtube video about this video game character. i didnt know about this game or this character beforehand, but they come from a really popular game apparently.

after doing some research, looking into their lore, even reading fanfics about them, i found myself completely attached over a matter of days. i found myself completely in love with him physically and emotionally. i basically know  everything about them. 

but for some reason, after seeing more and more content about him, i started to feel this sort of anxious, depressed, and maybe even suicidal feeling. i realized that he isn‚Äôt real, and he never will be able to love me. i won‚Äôt be able to live in his ‚Äúuniverse‚Äù and experience myself in his life because it‚Äôs just not possible. it hurt. and it caused me to spiral into a depressive episode in which i genuinely thought about killing myself because it hurt so much. i know it‚Äôs psychotic and stupid, and incredibly farfetched and crazy. but it‚Äôs how i felt. i was truly in so much pain. and i couldn‚Äôt tell anyone because i knew nobody would understand.

i began avoiding everything about the character. the video game they come from, the things about them, everything. even one small mention even remotely close to him would make my heart sink and ruin my day. i always think that he‚Äôs watching me too. watching me go to school, watching me eat, everything. i‚Äôm still so paranoid and obsessed with him, even though ive tried to remove this character from my online world.

I‚Äôm 18F and I‚Äôve been in college for a month. In the beginning I struggled to get to school on time due to some physical health issue that caused me to sleep though my alarm. I got all that figured out but now I‚Äôm late because I‚Äôm burnt out. I have adhd and bipolar1. Yeah my school knows about this but I still feel like I will get kicked out. Even if I don‚Äôt get kicked out, what happens when a job scout comes and they go ‚Äúwow she‚Äôs great at what she does tell me more‚Äù, and an instructor goes ‚Äúyeah I know she is really good, however she never shows up on time‚Äù. ?

The past few days despite having a had a good sleep, I wake up and I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this I‚Äôm not going‚Äù, and then I sleep in for hours ( in order to get ready and look ‚Äúpresentable‚Äù which is something we get graded on and is what job scouts are looking for, I need to wake up very early, and I have a very long bus ride to the school so that contributes to my early early wake up time to). I then usually wake up around or an hour after the time im supposed to have left already, and I still say I‚Äôm not doing this, and it takes SO MUCH convincing myself to get myself to go, especially while looking super worn out bc I don‚Äôt have time for makeup, and very unprofessional because I don‚Äôt have time to style my hair.

I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to succeed in life. I‚Äôve been fired from every job I‚Äôve ever had as a teenager, one of them I got fired from for different reasons, one of them being I looked to drained and un presentable and it was unacceptable ( house keeping, not even a job where I interact with tons of people), when I was barely surviving, trying to make it through school, and just trying to show up to work and get paid, despite my mental illness, and I had bad PTSD at the time from witnessing something intentionally gruesome and violent in person at the time. I barely graduated high school, nobody, not even my parents had thought that that would happen. And I technically but unofficially dropped out in 11th grade and never went during that year.

1jfix4o,2025-03-20T07:48:31,"Does anyone find happiness again after trauma?
The last time I felt excitement and happiness was when I was 18. 10 years ago.

My mental health decreased slowly. I used to put alot of effort into my health. I would jog, eat well, never consumes alcohol or drugs. 

I had 2 long term relationships since then, my last relationship turned me into a shell, with no personality and timid. I forgot what I liked to do and what I loved, trying to earn the love of a man who never intended to commit to me and used me like a convenience. It was really confusing, the phycological abuse was not damaging than the physical abuse. I believed everything he said, and did everything he told me to do- and he literally didn't have to do anything or give me anything except promise to love me.

In 2022 gave up on trust and finding love. I started drinking alcohol. I did any drug I wanted. I went from motivated and responsible to wreckless. I stopped working out, and I started eating whatever I wanted- mostly because I was trying to have a nice body for my boyfriend. So taking care of my health and watching my weight didn't matter to me anymore. My life revolved around his thoughts and likes. I wanted him to love me.

My question is, when do I feel better? How do I feel better? How do I start caring again? I miss caring about my pets, my life, my job, and myself.

I see a therapist and a psychiatrist. I take a ADHD medication now. 

I tried antidepressants- Zoloft, Prozac, Wellbutrin, and some others.The Wellbutrin made sucidal. The others made me unreasonably angry, I felt like I couldn't turn off my anger.

I picked up jogging and some weight lifting, but I don't love it. I hate doing it. I hate eating well too. I just want to eat noodles and that's it. I still have a couple drinks a day. I don't like to work anymore. I'm not passionate about my Future anymore. I hate where I live. I've tried to change my house but it still reminds me of the trauma. 

I feel stuck and burned out. And I don't have the energy anymore. I feel like it's getting worse. I miss how passionate I was about being alive.

1jflc9r,2025-03-20T10:57:40,"2025 has been rough
Tw for drug use, overdose, abuse, death, probably more

I'm just having rough year and I can't seem to catch a break.  It started with my mental health being garbage due to being harassed at work.  I was being harassed because of being disabled.  I reported it, but she made up lies about me instead and management decided it was hear say.  I ended up applying for medical leave because I was really not okay and the harassment was heavily affecting me and if I didn't take action I was scared of where things were headed.  But I was denied medical leave and I ended up missing work a bunch because I couldn't get myself to go.  I was fired about a month ago.  Right after I was fired, my mom almost died.  She spent awhile in the ICU where it came to light she's been hiding an addiction.  There's another post on my profile that goes more in depth on this if you want more information.  My bio dad is also an addict and relapsed this year.  During this, I tried to confide in my best friend of 14 years who instead unfriended me basically because I confided in her.  There is also a post on my profile that goes in depth on this situation too.  My mom is in rehab now.  I'm still not talking to her.  And I know she's gonna get home and try to act like nothing happened and like we all should move on.  I know I'm making the right choices for myself by staying firm on my boundaries and refusing that this just be sweeped under the rug and forgiven right away, but it's so hard and exhausting.  I'm so tired of having to advocate for myself.  I feel like I'm the only one being reasonable here.  Everyone thinks rehab is the end of it, but the rest of my family doesn't know what it's like to have an addict parent.  This shit stays around and it's something we need to watch for for the rest of our lives.  And I personally will likely never trust her again.  And I kind of blame her for losing my best friend.  I wouldn't have had to confide in her so much if my mom didn't give me so much to need to talk about, not just recently but my entire life.  I know that friendship wasn't real or beneficial but it still hurts.
Now the newest development, my mom's friend that brought her the drugs while she was in the ICU just overdosed.  They are in the ICU now and on life support.  I'm pissed that they brought my mom drugs and enabled her addiction, but I'm also incredibly sad and scared.  This friend means a lot to me.  Despite their struggles with addiction, I always looked up to them as a queer role model.  They helped me so much with queer issues my family didn't understand.  They inspire me to be a safe space for queer kids some day the way they were for me.  Things aren't looking good.  And the idea of them dying feels like a weight on my chest and I can't sleep.  I'm so scared we're gonna get the call that they died.  I keep having panic attacks.  I'm heart broken for their kid and their parents who already lost their other kid to overdose.  I don't know how to cope with everything.  My OCD is also using this to convince me I shouldn't take my meds because maybe I'll get addicted even though they aren't typically addictive.  In the last two months addiction has been the biggest thing on my mind.  It's something I've always feared for myself.  So much so that before any of this even happened, I made the decision that I wouldn't be drinking this year because I don't like how happy it makes me and how sad I feel after.  It's not like I drank often, at most once every 2 months.  But I know I am predisposed because of my parents and I'm not taking chances.  I also never smoked or did anything more than drink on occasion.  But I have nightmares about being an addict.  I looked into the family members of addicts support groups but I likely won't be able to attend one until Monday.  The only positive is that I am starting a new job and it seems like a great fit for me.  But I'm also worried that everything going on in my personal life is gonna affect my work and I'll get fired again.  Like what if I need to take off work within the first 90 days for a funeral?  What if I'm at work and I get that call?  Or I get the call that my mom decided to sign herself out of rehab?  Or maybe something else entirely?  I'm just so overwhelmed with everything and with the loss of my best friend I'm having trouble confiding in anyone else because I'm scared they'll say it's too much and leave me too.",2025 rough tw drug use overdose abuse death probably im rough year cant seem catch break started mental health garbage due harassed work harassed disabled reported made lies instead management decided hear say ended applying medical leave really okay harassment heavily affecting didnt take action scared things headed denied medical leave ended missing work bunch couldnt get go fired month ago right fired mom almost died spent awhile icu came light shes hiding addiction theres another post profile goes depth want information bio dad also addict relapsed year tried confide best friend 14 years instead unfriended basically confided also post profile goes depth situation mom rehab im still talking know shes gonna get home try act like nothing happened like move know im making right choices staying firm boundaries refusing sweeped rug forgiven right away hard exhausting im tired advocate feel like im one reasonable everyone thinks rehab end rest family doesnt know like addict parent shit stays around something need watch rest lives personally likely never trust kind blame losing best friend wouldnt confide much mom didnt give much need talk recently entire life know friendship wasnt real beneficial still hurts newest development moms friend brought drugs icu overdosed icu life support im pissed brought mom drugs enabled addiction im also incredibly sad scared friend means lot despite struggles addiction always looked queer role model helped much queer issues family didnt understand inspire safe space queer kids day way things arent looking good idea dying feels like weight chest cant sleep im scared gonna get call died keep panic attacks im heart broken kid parents already lost kid overdose dont know cope everything ocd also using convince shouldnt take meds maybe ill get addicted even though arent typically addictive last two months addiction biggest thing mind something ive always feared much even happened made decision wouldnt drinking year dont like happy makes sad feel like drank often every 2 months know predisposed parents im taking chances also never smoked anything drink occasion nightmares addict looked family members addicts support groups likely wont able attend one monday positive starting new job seems like great fit im also worried everything going personal life gonna affect work ill get fired like need take work within first 90 days funeral im work get call get call mom decided sign rehab maybe something else entirely im overwhelmed everything loss best friend im trouble confiding anyone else im scared theyll say much leave,1,0,0,Neutral,Low,[],[]

I'm 17 years old and I've struggled with my mental health ever since I was around 13. For that past year my mental health has been the worst that its ever been. Before I would go through small and short depressive episodes and then I would start feeling somewhat happy again. Lately I get depressive thoughts multiple times a day and when I'm at home I think about cutting myself with art supplies that sit on my desk in my room.

I would ask for help but the thing is, when I opened up about my struggles in the past to my parents, my dad didn't have a good reaction in my opinion. It wasn't a horrible reaction but the way my brain processes people's negative reactions make it seem like I'm the problem and it's my fault. The thing is, is that my dad has clinical depression and he was worried that I might have it (I still don't know cause I was never diagnosed) and so that's the reason for the poor reaction. The other reason to why I won't ask for help is because I don't want to, the thought of death makes me giddy and feel at peace.

I don't know what to do, if I should ask for help or let my thoughts consume me. I'm tired, unmotivated, I can't cry, I'm constantly overstimulated even though I'm not diagnosed with anything, and I just hate the world and myself.",dont know im 17 years old ive struggled mental health ever since around 13 past year mental health worst ever would go small short depressive episodes would start feeling somewhat happy lately get depressive thoughts multiple times day im home think cutting art supplies sit desk room would ask help thing opened struggles past parents dad didnt good reaction opinion wasnt horrible reaction way brain processes peoples negative reactions make seem like im problem fault thing dad clinical depression worried might still dont know cause never diagnosed thats reason poor reaction reason wont ask help dont want thought death makes giddy feel peace dont know ask help let thoughts consume im tired unmotivated cant cry im constantly overstimulated even though im diagnosed anything hate world,1,2,0,Negative,Low,[],[]

1jfh77e,2025-03-20T05:47:36,"I love you always
Those beautiful brown eyes, those beautiful brown hair, that beautiful face, that breathtaking smile, she was like an angel. That feeling of holding her face, that feeling of holding her hand, her in my arms, holding my arms where ever we go, the way she looks at me with all her love, the feeling of calling her mine, those are the most beautiful thing that a guy experiences. She was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen I know she was way out of my league. But when you get her with all her trust that is when you achieve it. Yes, I got her, I got that most beautiful she is like she has dropped from heaven, it feels like heaven is there where I am with her. She was my destiny. She was my niyati.¬†
Wanna know how I got her let‚Äôs start from the beginning,
I was studying in a hostel and it was the time of corona and we were all home. It was my 15th birthday and like every time at 12 I get all the wishes and then there was a special wish from the girl who was my classmate and we used to go to the same tuition. It was a very long text wishing me and remembering our memories. I joined the hostel when I was in 9th and at this time I was in 10th. Like every other guy, I started stalking her and then there was a pic of her in a white saree no not white it was a silverish saree. She looked too beautiful in that pic I saw that picture a hundred times before sleeping that is how beautiful she was looking. That was the most beautiful smile I had ever seen.¬†¬†Then it was just a one sided crush I had nothing to do about it. Then there was my best friend who was even her best friend while texting him he casually asks me if I have a girlfriend I say no and then he asks me why you are good looking and why don‚Äôt you have a girlfriend. I tell him that I did find anyone who can be one and I ask him to find me a girlfriend. I was expecting her name very badly and then he gives me a choice of two girls in those two girls she was there. That made me so happy. That feeling was just different. Then I choose her and then he asks me are you sure I told him yes. And then it hit me what if she rejects me that would be very bad. He explains to me she is a very good girl and she won‚Äôt hurt me like that but still I was scared. Then he tells me that she was hurt by a person very badly that she cried for 3 months. There was a guy called Vaibhav who was her best friend who started liking her and then he confesses to her but she just wanted to be friends with him so she reject him then he abused her very badly that hurt her very much. She used to cry every day for that reason. So as a best friend, he makes sure that she would be safe and happy and I promised him that I would keep her happy.¬†
The next day he texts her about me and then she asks me to her. My hands were shivering to text her, so I give my account to my best friend to text her. She texts me and then I confess my feeling to her. She asks me to give her some time the next day she called me for the first time on July 25. We talked for one and a half hours the first time we talked. That was the best feeling I had. That satisfaction after the call. She asked me to call her at night and I did we spoke and days went by,¬†¬†we became very close the day did not pass by without talking to her. Then on 15 Aug, she confesses her love like she proposed me, and then after 2 days, we met.¬†¬†She had told her mom about me that I was her boyfriend and she was cool with it. The first time I met her was at her home where I took my friend. The first time she sees me she gives a long hug and I‚Äôm a hug guy who needs hugs we had talked about it so she gives me a long and warm hug. She takes me to her room we talk, her mom gives us privacy and also made us some sandwiches. I was very shy so I could not talk to her or eat her sandwich. Her mom was very good. At last, the hug and she whispers in my ears¬†¬†‚ÄúI love you‚Äù That gave me goosebumps. That was so special felt like never leaving that hug.¬†
There are two types of girlfriends in this world the one who gets jealous when the boyfriends look at other girls and the one who stalks other girls with her boyfriend. So my girlfriend was the second type. Then after some days, we meet in a mall we walked we ate and yeah we stalked others too we rated them. She asked me to find a girl whose LHS=RHS. If you know what that means. We had too much fun. She held my arms the whole time and never left it. That was the cutest thing. We started meeting very often every day was special with her. She was the best thing in my life precious that should be kept.
I‚Äôve got two sisters and they are the best we share everything. I had a friend group of five in which my younger sister was also there. They were Samyuk aka Chintu, Ishita aka Appi, Vasishta aka Vasi, and my sister Srishti aka Chinnu, Ishita, and Samyuk were siblings they were my friends from 2nd standard. So we plan to go on a road trip to Sakleshpur where Vasishta‚Äôs family and¬†¬†Chintu‚Äôs family agreed to come. Our parents did not come but they let us go with them. Two of them also join with us, Nithin and Lakshmi. So all the boys come to one car with Vasishta‚Äôs dad and Chintu‚Äôs parents and Vasi‚Äôs mom and the girls go in another car. We the boys had the best time we talked we played our favorite songs and Vasishta‚Äôs dad became so close to us that we started calling him Baba that‚Äôs what Vasi used to call him. He told us ghost stories in the car while Vasi was driving he scared the shit out of us, he told the stories that he had experienced. That was the best memory of the whole trip vasi‚Äôs dad telling us stories we also went to a fall where Vasi‚Äôs dad was the first one to get into the water and gave us some motivation and he found new places that were soo beautiful he was the first one to do the most fun things. He was the best. We had the best memories from that trip.
So, then it was time to go to the hostel before we meet for the last time in a mall she surprises me from behind hugged me from behind in public doesn‚Äôt leave for a very long time, we had the best time for the first time she kisses me on the cheek thank god I captured it and some of the boys tease us and then we run away from there then I walk her till her home kiss her on the cheeks for the last time say goodbye and then leave I go to hostel and used to call her every Sunday. Every Sunday we used to talk for five minutes yes it was hard very hard but we were handling it at the same Vaibhav started talking to her and I was ok with it I trusted her and I have no problems or insecurities. Then on Feb 10 I fall sick and one guy was maintaining a phone in the hostel who was very close to me and he gives me the phone that had no sim to use with the help of wifi because he knew that I missed her a lot. I used to keep the sweatshirt that I wore when I met her for the last time near my pillow. So I text her and send her a picture of that then she told me she wanted to talk to me and then in the evening I take a phone call from my warden. Then she tells me that her dad came crying to her that something had happened in their family that was related to a relationship one of her cousin was caught that left a very bad mark on their family. So he asks her to break up with any guy if there is one and then her mom tells her to do what she wants to so she decides to break up. Even if I was there in her place even I would prioritize my dad over her. At last, she tells me that I would never find another guy that is left to my dad and she asks me to call on the coming Sunday. I go to my best friend Moiz I hug him and the tears started falling I cried too much he handled me and made me understand. I was in no state to talk to her I did not call her and Sundays pass by without calling her. Then on March 31, it was her birthday I call her she acts like she doesn‚Äôt even recognize my voice then I tell her wish her talk for some time she asks me if I have found a new girl I say no, and then after keeping the call, she calls me once again I say HIII yes the excited one but it was not her it was her mom she asks me to never call again because she gets hurt. So I don‚Äôt call her again.¬†
The summer holidays come and I come home there I see was still following her on Instagram many new dance videos of her made me feel very bad I couldn‚Äôt handle seeing her so I unfollow her and then after some days she blocks me that made me regret doing that. Then there was no way to reach her I felt that was good but that made it worse it made me miserable her more but I had to move on. I couldn‚Äôt move on because I loved her very much no guy can ever move on with their first love. Then I go to the hostel the days pass by I was happy with my friends they were the main thing in my life that made me happy made me laugh made me understand.
I missed her every day I used to talk about her all the time and the days passed by. From Jan 9 I had my Sankranti holidays every time the driver used to come to pick me up but this time my father and sister come to pick me up. I was very happy that they came to pick me up I sit in the car take my sister‚Äôs phone and start scrolling and watching stories then in one of the stories of my best friend who made us meet. In his story, there was a picture of her and there was a caption that ‚ÄúYou will be missed‚Äù then my sister snatched the phone I ask her what happened and she tells me that she committed suicide I ask her why she tells method she doesn‚Äôt know I look and her forget to breathe after some time take deep breath tears start falling couldn‚Äôt control myself start crying very badly they make me drink water I handled myself I come home I sit on the sofa and I take my mom‚Äôs phone and I casually check the gallery and I see a screenshot of a status of someone of Vasishta‚Äôs dad and then I saw the caption and it said RIP, I was broke I go lock myself in the room started getting all those memories and cried it all out my sisters come to try to handle me but that did not help I just wanted to be alone but my parents were too scared to leave me alone in the evening I go meet Vasishta in the evening and he tells me that his father had a disease called early Parkinson it came to a point where he had to take tablets every 2 hours and her couldn‚Äôt handle it and shot himself. I hug him and comfort him by telling him that we are there for him.
After some days I go meet her best friend who was even my best friend and another on of my best friend I ask them the reason for her doing that and even they did not know and my best friend tells me that there was story of her being very close to vaibhav and I ask her to send me that and in the evening it was one of my sister‚Äôs birthday we went to a family dinner and while coming back she send me the pic I saw her sitting on vaibhav and other pics which were very close and my sister tells me that there were rumors that they were in a relationship and I did not believe her and laughed at her and then I go to my room and ask her best friend that were the in a relationship and she replies that yes they were and continues that it did not have to be this way, I was broke I become numb and then after some time I text her was the reason for our break up was true or not then she tells me that yes it was true her father had become very strict and used to sit beside her all the time for some months but after some months he had become little less strict and that‚Äôs when this happened it was just 3 months before her passing away they got into a relationship.

So this was my story and the main thing of this story is how did I get over it someone has rightly said that ‚Äú If you really want to be happy in life start pretending that you are happy and you will really be happy ‚Äú when you are depressed never pick things that can hurt you rather play your favorite song start dancing go to you friends or family to make you feel better. I was lost for some time a very long time actually but I have got good sisters and friends who got me over that phase even you will have someone in your life who can make you happy go to them and if you don‚Äôt have one make one meet new people who make you better person never be scared of getting hurt because remember you have had worse of that. Be positive all the time, I only feel good for the good memories that I have had with her whereas I ignore all the bad memories. I only embrace the good time that we have had. Remember all the things we‚Äôve done together even now when I hear her name or remember one of her memory it feels like there is a knot int my breath. You know you will be very good until people show sympathy on you and to avoid it is to not let people know what you have been through be normal get along with them never let them know about your past life your life would be blissful.¬†

My journey with her was very short but, she has become a memorable one for lifetime. And lastly I just want say ‚ÄúI‚Äôve known love because of you. This pains me, but I hope you are in a better place now, Niyati.¬†I love you always.",love always beautiful brown eyes beautiful brown hair beautiful face breathtaking smile like angel feeling holding

Hi everyone. I have a friend with some pretty severe childhood trauma. And without giving away any potentially triggering details, I can tell you that what she endured as a child is literally the worst of the worst and ended up leading to her developing a whole bunch of both mental and physical health issues. 
So here‚Äôs some background info about this friend. She‚Äôs 50 years old, unemployed but lives on a large and extremely beautiful property in the country with a bunch of rescue animals. To people looking in from the outside, they would think she has it all. But her childhood trauma has lead to her having really severe depression and PTSD which she copes with by taking sleeping pills. She doesn‚Äôt drink or use any illegal drugs, and she often speaks very proudly about this, because I don‚Äôt think she understands that the way she takes sleeping meds is an issue. There have been countless times over the years when she told me she took so much medication the night before that she didn‚Äôt think she would wake up and this absolutely terrifies me. She also doesn‚Äôt have a set schedule, which is one of the worst things you can do when you have depression. She often sleeps all day and stays up all night, doesn‚Äôt keep her house clean and just struggles to function overall. But despite what she has been through, she is the kindest person I know. Not one of the kindest, THE kindest. I have no idea how someone who has endured so much cruelty, could turn out so kind and all I want is for her to be able to enjoy life. 
I‚Äôm hoping to visit her over the weekend and I really want to chat with her about my concerns. But I‚Äôm afraid that she might not be receptive. The irony about this whole situation, is that I am also very mentally ill, with my own list of diagnosed mental health issues and traumas, which is actually why we clicked so well. So I 100% understand where she‚Äôs coming from. 
But I‚Äôm afraid that if she doesn‚Äôt change, she‚Äôs going to overdose or worse, stay the same and never get to be happy. Would anyone have any advice on how I could approach these very delicate issues? Or how I can support her if she isn‚Äôt receptive or open to change? I love her so much, and I don‚Äôt want to lose her and there is nothing more that I want then for her to have a chance to enjoy life.

( throwaway account)
Hello all,

The following text is summarized by chatgpt. Thanks to my scrambled brain,  the initial number of words were around 4000. I summarized it to get to the point using chatgpt. I tend to deviate and add a lot of points that may not be required so I used this.

Also I have a tendency to elaborate something that can be communicated in a simple sentence,  and I apologise for this.

Thank you for your patience to read through everything. //


I was raised by my single mother after my father passed away when I was 15. She loved me unconditionally, but I struggled with consistency and discipline. Despite bursts of energy and focus, I failed at basic responsibilities‚Äîstudying for exams, attending college, and taking care of my health.

 My procrastination and tendency to seek distractions led to deep guilt, self-hate, and episodes of running away from home at 11 and 18. Both times, I was overwhelmed by feelings of failure and even considered self-harm. My loved ones found me and showed me I was cared for, which kept me moving forward, though my struggles remained.

I fell in love with a woman who encouraged me but also isolated me from my friends. We married, had a son, and things quickly turned toxic. She became controlling, used our child as leverage, and even joined a cult church,  changing our son‚Äôs name without my consent.

 Eventually, she falsely accused me and my family of domestic violence and assault, leading to a seven-year legal battle that took everything from me. COVID prolonged it, but I was eventually cleared of all charges. We divorced, she cut me off from my son for four years.

Recently, she reached out with regret. I refused reconciliation but discussed our son's future. After years of being kept away, my son has now agreed to meet me in a month.

Yet, despite overcoming so much, I feel paralyzed in my professional and personal life. I work remotely and have vast experience in some areas but lack confidence in others. I have opportunities to grow, increase my income, and improve my life, yet I fail to take action.

 I lost a business deal because I couldn‚Äôt send a simple email for weeks. I have a business opportunity but haven‚Äôt even started preparing. Instead, I spend 14 hours daily mindlessly scrolling social media. I dread talking to clients, but I prolong trivial phone calls with friends to escape reality. It's like there are others working on the deliverables but I just become a bottle neck and the entire thing just stops bcoz of my inaction. It could be as simple as forwarding to the client an email with an attachment sent to me by my team members.

I binge on junk food daily while forcing myself to the gym 3‚Äì4 times a week. 

My biggest fear is that my son might inherit my struggles‚Äîthe inability to take action despite knowing what needs to be done, the tendency to procrastinate, and the addiction to distractions.

What‚Äôs Next?

I know I need to take control, but I don‚Äôt know where to start.

I have opportunities to grow professionally, but I‚Äôm stuck in a cycle of inaction.

I have a second chance to be a father to my son, but I fear failing him.

I have dreams, interests, and goals, but I can‚Äôt seem to execute them.

I don‚Äôt want to be stuck in this cycle anymore. I just don‚Äôt know how to break free.

1jea5a8,2025-03-18T18:12:35,"Intense Anxiety
I (F2O) am feeling quite overwhelmed and anxious right now. These feelings are really difficult to put into words, but I'm going to try my best. For context, I'm in a relationship with someone who is 5 years older than me and in my last year of a university degree. Basically, I'm really struggling with confidence/comparing myself with my peers and partner. It's such an awful feeling, but I just feel like I have nothing going for me, and everybody else does. This whole thing was so much worse last year, but in November, I started going to therapy and it has improved somewhat. I've come to the realisation that although I love what I studied for my first degree, I think I'm going to go ahead and pursue a second degree in a related area (getting a bachelor degree is free where I'm from). I've also started exercising and doing yoga, and making art like pottery and writing. 

Despite this I really struggle with anxiety and this constant feeling of being ""incomplete"" and as though everyone around me has it much better than I do, or that they're going to make it and I am not. This has been amplified recently because I failed my driving test and it absolutely crushed me (this was my first attempt.) My car is bought and my parents pay for my lessons, so I also feel really guilty that they're going to have to keep doing that. I'm terrified that I'll never pass, because I want it really bad. I'm mentioning this because since I failed it, the feeling of being a failure has been amplified by a thousand.  I feel like I should have my license by this age. I'm ashamed. Every time I catch the bus, I feel this sense of shame because some of my friends have their license, my boyfriend has it, and I feel judged or looked down upon. 

I also have really bad financial anxiety paired with guilt. Luckily, my parents have always helped me out, and support me furthering my education, but I feel so bad that they need to provide for me. My partner also works in a very respected and high earning field, whilst I'm interested in teaching and working with children, so I know I definitely won't be the breadwinner in the relationship. I just have this massive anxiety around money, and spending my own money on myself (which I work hard for).

But it was not as simple as i think and absolutely i cant take out it from my mind.

And then i need different strange and brutal things from my owner for example to be tortured different parts of my body using different pinpoint materials, sharp materials, brutally tied by thin strong cables, brutally bitten, ect. Also in addition to the torturing also i need from my owmer to make me to be amputated all my limbs and live being DAK DAE quad amputee by stump crawling.

1jen3nz,2025-03-19T03:39:57,"I am so comfortable with my own mortality that its concerning my friends and there worried for my mental health but i dont see anything wrong with how i think, thoughts?
( there is a TLDR at the bottom if you dont want to read this all )

So here is my story so you can get to understand why i have accepted my own mortality and that i will die one day

So for started my older brother has a condition that has causes little holes to form in his lungs where air leaks in and when the holes close pressure can build up and eventually his lungs pop and collapse, they finally did a surgery to fix it after his lungs collapsed and they fixed it for the 9th time, he has staples in both his lungs, and is missing a third of one of his lungs. While this genetic illness is most common ( but still very rare ) in men its even rarer in woman but i was unlucky and also ended up getting it, while my lungs have yet to collapse i have already had multiple micro pops since high school ( im 20 now) which cause some chest pain

the thing is with this illness you cant predict it. As im writing this right now one of both of my lungs could just tear apart in my chest and there is NOTHING i can do to stop it. Even the surgery they figured out to fix it they can only do AFTER my lung collapses per lung so my lungs are rn just time bombs waiting to go off

I learned my lungs where like this from a blood test at age 5 so already i have been aware of my own mortality from a very young age

I later read a book series in elementary school called ""a series of unfortunate events"" and in the 5th book i learned the saying Memento Mori which is Latin and pretty much translates to ""accept your death and that you will die one day"" and i did, i realized that saying was the moto of my life now and i lived with it even to this day. I know im going to die and it could happen any moment and i accept it and i will just keep living my life, watching anime, playing soccer, going to college, ect

I also have a heart condition i learned about in high school that makes my heart so sensitive to medication that most ADHD meds make me pass out and further increases my risk of heart attack

I have also been close to death in other ways, I almost drowned in a rushing river after a flood in 8th grade, broke my skull open at 2 years old and still have a scar on the back of my head from it, and Hell my mom even told me it took 3 days for me to be born since i had the ambilocal cord around my neck AND she smoked while pregnant with me which has deformed my ribs

The main part my friends find concerning about this is the fact i fantasize about my own death and even planned stuff out if i do die since i was 17 years old

when im bored in class i imagine if someone broke and with a gun or something and play a few scenario's. 2 where im the hero but i die in one but live in the other both of which are more unrealistic like im the hero in an action movie while the other scenario are me either me dying realistically or me saving the day realistically and i think about how that would effect those in my life as well i do the same thing when im falling to sleep if someone was getting mugged or robbed and my friends find that concerning

they also find it concerning i have rn in my wallet i have a piece of paper that tells where i hid a key to a small safe of mine, in that safe is one thing, a piece of paper that contains a password an email, the only thing i have used this email for is to create a Google doc. Said google doc has a list of who i want to go to my funeral which i update every few months if i need to, personalized letters to every single one of my close friends and family members, orders to give all my money to my niece and nephew, and who to give certain things of mine to. I wrote it since if i suddenly die today, tomorrow, or in a few years i want to make sure people know how i cared about them, i want to make sure people get certain things, and i dont want to risk anyone missing my funeral

I told my friends about it and even where the key to said safe is just incase when i day my wallet is lost they can get to the piece of paper so my final messages to everyone is not lost and what i want to happen after my death is not lost

They all think im way to comfortable with my own mortality and are concerned for my mental health but to me its just part of life

If you read all this thank you i know its pretty long but apricate if you made it all the way threw

What are your thoughts? am i weird for this? am i to comfortable with my own mortality?

TDLR: I have various heath conditions that have made me know from 5 years old i could no joke die as im writing this and have been near death many times. Because of this i do fantasy's where im a hero and either live or die trying to stop a school shooter or save some one from being mugged, and also have a google doc with my last wishes planned out, personalized massages to all my friends and family, and who i want at my funeral incase i die suddenly and i told my friends about it incase the piece of paper in my wallet that directs people to the google doc is lost they can still find it and there concerned about me for this since they say a 20 year old should not be this ok and thinking about there own death so much and are worried about my mental health.

Hi all, looking some advice or insight if possible about my cousin (M23) who has previously been diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression, but I now strongly suspect that there's something more serious or sinister. 
We've convinced him to come to the hospital in the morning, but based on the below symptoms, could you please give your thoughts on what may happen?
SYMPTOMS: Irritable and restless, unable to sleep, more energetic, disturbingly 'positive', reports thoughts and desires of suicide and self harm and is delusional. Sadly he's awaiting sentencing from court and will probably go to prison (was previously on remand and didn't cope well), so his delusional thoughts centre around that he thinks police are out to get him, that prison officers want him to commit suicide and the Judge sentencing him wants his death certificate and how he feels he has to do this. Not long ago he went missing in a forest and police had to search for him.
Upon hearing his symptoms, would the hospital be more likely than not to admit/section him? I think he could really do with it, and we're hoping that when the judge learns of this she will impose a Hospital Order, rather than a prison term. 

Thanks again guys! Kind replies only plz!",cousin needing sectioned delusions hi looking advice insight possible cousin m23 previously diagnosed severe anxiety depression strongly suspect theres something serious sinister weve convinced come hospital morning based symptoms could please give thoughts may happen symptoms irritable restless unable sleep energetic disturbingly positive reports thoughts desires suicide self harm delusional sadly hes awaiting sentencing court probably go prison previously remand didnt cope well delusional thoughts centre around thinks police get prison officers want commit suicide judge sentencing wants death certificate feels long ago went missing forest police search upon hearing symptoms would hospital likely admitsection think could really hoping judge learns impose hospital order rather prison term thanks guys kind replies plz,1,1,0,Neutral,Low,[],[]

Im 21 and have been living in my first apartment for 7 months now. I originally moved here for college, but I had an intense depressive episode during first semester that caused me to drop out. I recovered a bit over winter break at home with my family and decided I wanted to stay at my apartment since I had made some good friends in the city and found a good therapist here as well. I moved back in January and started looking for a job so I could afford to stay at my apartment. I recently got a job and started there almost 3 weeks ago now. Now it‚Äôs like I can feel myself slipping all over again. I really thought this was something I could do, something I wanted to do so bad. I love my apartment, i love being near my friends and even my new job is pretty good. So why am I crying myself to sleep every night? why do I struggle to get out of bed in the morning? why do I hate myself more and more each day? Why do I still have persistent thoughts of suicide? I‚Äôve been unable to see my therapist since starting my job because i‚Äôm still trying to figure my schedule out, but I don‚Äôt know if even that will be enough anymore. I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can hold on like this, but ending up in the hospital or moving home is the last thing I want to do right now.

Hi.   
I've been depressed since December, on SSRIS since January and for about a month I'm on sick leave. It finally feels like I'm getting better. Buttt life is still absolutely pointless to me.

It's one thing when you're healthy and you think life's pointless, but it's waay more excruciating to feel that way while depressed or recovering. Depression broke me in ways I could never imagine. And there's no guarantee it wont be back in the future. Today I feel fine, but tomorrow - idk. I can't trust myself/my brain. I already had a lot to deal with, but with depression added to my list - idk if life's worth to live. It's just too much. Working, seeking out people¬†to connect with, all the stuff we all need to do to survive - I just can't do this anymore. 

Many times I've been so angry that others are trying to save me. ""It's my life. Can't I do whatever I want with it?? Just let me go!"". It is also very painful to see myself in this condition. 

I feel much better now - I can laugh, enjoy sunny days and taking a shower, I want to go outside for a long walk someday. I don't hate people for enjoying their lives anymore. But I'm still exhausted. And if it gets worse again, I don't think I'll be able to fight it. When/if another wave of depression hits me, I want to have a solid reason to stay alive and keep fighting.   
This time I thought of my family and my cat, but sometimes, even with all of them in mind, I was ready to give up.   
Clearly not a good enough reason. And I can't think of anything else. Feel hopeless.

F24 with moderate-severe depression, OCD, C-PTSD, and past eating disorder behaviors.
	‚Ä¢	April 2023: Started sertraline (Zoloft) for 1.5 years (up to 150mg). Over time, it became less effective and caused temp regulation issues & sexual dysfunction. It didn‚Äôt help much with OCD.
	‚Ä¢	Also started Buspar & propranolol for acute anxiety (still use them). Hydroxyzine was too sedating.
	‚Ä¢	Stopped Zoloft and was off antidepressants for a few months but needed to restart.

Medication History
	‚Ä¢	Desvenlafaxine (Pristiq): 25mg had little effect, 50mg caused severe depression & SI ‚Üí stopped immediately.
	‚Ä¢	Auvelity: Started 3/7, changed to every other day on 3/21 due to suspected rapid metabolism. Improved motivation & mood but had strong side effects:
	‚Ä¢	Euphoria, memory loss, difficulty focusing
	‚Ä¢	Increased heart rate (felt winded after minimal exertion)
	‚Ä¢	Shortness of breath, increased anxiety, worsened OCD/C-PTSD

Ultimately, Auvelity wasn‚Äôt a good fit, even with dose adjustments. Last dose 3/25.

Current Situation
	‚Ä¢	Withdrawal symptoms (starting 3/27): Brain zaps, dizziness, disorientation, extreme fatigue. Surprised to experience withdrawal after only 2.5 weeks.
	‚Ä¢	Next steps: Exploring Trintellix, but insurance coverage is uncertain. Looked into Takeda‚Äôs program but may not qualify.
	‚Ä¢	Alternative options: Psychiatrist mentioned Viibryd, but therapist is unsure due to my high medication sensitivity. Wellbutrin was considered, but Auvelity (which contains bupropion) increased my anxiety.

Hi Guys, as the title says, I am looking for 3 people with depression, who do not have a trigger in their environment (just lost a job, partner left etc), but suspect, it might come from their body. Of course we all have our problems and life is tough, but I am looking specifically for individuals who have been depressed since a long time and can't really figure out why.

I have made a previous post and we are three people, but if more want to join, you are welcome. We start saturday, 29th! 

I am a nutritionist and have great results with treating depression through nutrition and lifestyle changes. I also include trauma and nervous system work, but mostly concentrate on the body, because 80% of serotonin is made in the gut and the microbiome plays a HUGE role.

So I am looking for 3 individuals who are willing to work with me for a few months. You don't have to pay me, but if you have good results, please recommend me to others.

You don't have to buy supplements from me (you might need some stuff, but can get that wherever it is convenient), but you might have to do some testing (blood, urine, stool) and be willing to give any diet changes your all and be serious about it (no worries, you will be well fed and taken care of).

we are going to have one/two appointments each month, maybe even in a group call and hopefully get you out of the darkness, into the light.

I‚Äôm going through a sort of hard time right now after being laid off. Also this is bs I can‚Äôt bring myself to tell anyone I actually know.

I had to get new insurance today and then try to get a new psychiatrist and a new therapist. And when I called the insurance they had a small questionnaire that included the have you ever tried had a suicide attempt. And I said no like regular. But afterwards I was thinking. There was that one time I was depressed and found my jugular vein and pressed a box cutter to it to test it a bit. But I realized it already hurt a little and I probably couldn‚Äôt commit and didn‚Äôt have health insurance at the time so I‚Äôd probably just end up with a big bill. So I stopped and didn‚Äôt even have a scratch. And there was this other time when I had foot surgery (with health insurance) and they gave me some opioid painkillers and I specifically took as few as possible and saved the rest, but eventually a couple months later I got a therapist and told them I had them and the therapist of course didn‚Äôt like this and I had to throw them away otherwise they would have called the police. I didn‚Äôt like this at all, but before I threw them away I looked online if I had a solid dose that would kill and I did. And then I held them in my hands a bit to think about how I thought about them. And I couldn‚Äôt take them then. I wanted them in case I needed them later but I couldn‚Äôt take them at that particular day. I couldn‚Äôt throw them away either. So I ended up going to my sister‚Äôs place and told her that I needed her to go to my place and throw them out. And I did figure out a new way I could attempt suicide, but it requires me to go 6 miles to the next city over to this particular place but then it‚Äôs a problem that every time I‚Äôm actually that depressed, leaving my room and going 6 miles away feels like too much. 

But that was all in the past and I was fine until I got laid off and I feel almost like I could be back there sometimes.

I'm 37 years old and for many years i deal with depression, I didn't have a job, I was living alone and didn't want to see anybody, I was like that for aprox 10 years, years that I didn't make any progress for my life, suddenly like 3 years ago the only person I have a relationship Ghost me, didn't blame her tough, but something make me feel that I could hurt myself if I didn't change things, so I did, I look for a therapist myself, this time there wasn't anyone telling me to look for one it was me, and after a couple months my therapist told me that I should also look for a psychologist and get medicated, I also start a low level job in a call center, it wasn't much but it was something and I was working, something that I never did for many years and I felt, well better, no happy, but better.

A year and a half past and I was a very different person, I had a job change for the better, it's still a entry level job but it is in a law firm and I like working there, I'm hitting the gym almost daily, and I feel that things are improving.

Then a couple months ago I receive a text from a Ex girlfriend from before I was in the depression time, she and I part ways sometime before I fell to that bad place in my mind, truth be told part of the breakup with her was that, she saw me getting worse month by month and at the end I decided to break up, I know I wasn't making her happy.  And a couple months ago she text me, she said she was remembering me, and we start seeing each other, we hook up, she said she always love me, that she was gonna love me for the rest of her life, and I, I love her too, a lot, I smile so much every time I see her, I was happy beyond belief, I though this was my happy ending.

But of course, life is not like that, she has a life too, she is married for about 10 years, no kids though, but she said her husband is a good person and he hasn't do anything bad to her ever. So I get desperate and told her that I want to be with her completely, that if she is gonna leave him and we are gonna start something good, because that's what I wanted, we have this fight like 3 times, third time she tells me that no, she is not gonna leave him, that was monday, and she kinda cut communication with me, but told me we are gonna see us this Friday, but apart from that she doesn't reply to my messages or calls.

And now I'm here, feeling like shit, crying, begging, with fear of ending in a bad place again, I'm not going to the gym, not leaving my house, and im behind in my work because I'm not doing the things I should be doing, I really thought she was the happyness life was preparing for me, I see her and I think she is beautiful and funny and sparkling I don't know, she was that part that is still missing in my life, and I'm here now, desperate, with a pain in the chest, cannot stop crying, and in my bed, I love her and I'm not gonna be with her, I didn't want to be the guy she is cheating with, I want something more with her, a life, and now I don't have anything, tomorrow she is gonna see me only to say goodbye I know, I hate myself for being weak, I hate myself for feeling like this again, and I don't know what to do to put myself together again.",looking words support please im 37 years old many years deal depression didnt job living alone didnt want see anybody like aprox 10 years years didnt make progress life suddenly like 3 years ago person relationship ghost didnt blame tough something make feel could hurt didnt change things look therapist time wasnt anyone telling look one couple months therapist told also look psychologist get medicated also start low level job call center wasnt much something working something never many years felt well better happy better year half past different person job change better still entry level job law firm like working im hitting gym almost daily feel things improving couple months ago receive text ex girlfriend depression time part ways sometime fell bad place mind truth told part breakup saw getting worse month month end decided break know wasnt making happy couple months ago text said remembering start seeing hook said always love gonna love rest life love lot smile much every time see happy beyond belief though happy ending course life like life married 10 years kids though said husband good person hasnt anything bad ever get desperate told want completely gonna leave gonna start something good thats wanted fight like 3 times third time tells gonna leave monday kinda cut communication told gonna see us friday apart doesnt reply messages calls im feeling like shit crying begging fear ending bad place im going gym leaving house im behind work im things really thought happyness life preparing see think beautiful funny sparkling dont know part still missing life im desperate pain chest cannot stop crying bed love im gonna didnt want guy cheating want something life dont anything tomorrow gonna see say goodbye know hate weak hate feeling like dont know put together,3,8,0,Neutral,Low,['kinda'],"[(57.9946553, 15.8926885)]"

long story short, i was relapsing on my porn addiction and downloaded a bunch of pics/vids off the internet to put in a google drive account. it's not directly under my name but it could probably be sourced back to me. the next day, the account was permanently disabled for hosting content that involves harming/sexually abusing children. i have no idea how this happened and i'm mortified by it but i'm aware that it's probably true.

google sends out cybertips to many agencies about this kind of thing, and it leads to serious investigation. people might come to my house/dorm and seize all of my computers/electronics, and i will be sent to prison for a mistake. im going to try selling my macbook because even though the files have been deleted they could be recovered and used as evidence.

i'm terrified, and i've never actually contemplated suicide until now. i have no idea of if they'l come for me, or when they'll come for me. people could come knocking in two weeks or six months or two years, or never. i don't have anyone that i can tell about this and i'd rather kill myself then go to prison and have everyone think i'm a monster. i don't know what to do, i feel like my world is ending and all hope for my future is gone. please comment, i can't tell if i should be prepping for the FBI at my door or if i'm just spiraling.

Depression isn‚Äôt a disease. It‚Äôs a mental state. And the only way out? **Action.** Society wants you weak‚Äîhooked on therapy, pills, and self-pity. That‚Äôs a **lie.** Depression dies when you take control.

üí• **Right now, do 10 push-ups. Feel that? That‚Äôs power.**  
üí• **Say out loud: ""I refuse to be weak.""**

# Step 1: Stop Playing the Victim

The more you call yourself ""depressed,"" the more powerless you become. Your mind is a battlefield‚Äîyou either **win or lose.** No one is coming to save you. **Save yourself.**

üöÄ **Right now, record a video saying:**  
üî• ""I will dominate my life. I will try my best at Plan A, excel at Plan B (if A doesnt work out), and build powerful connections.""  
**Watch it daily.**

# Step 2: Get a Plan B ‚Äì Money Gives You Power

Depression thrives in a life you hate. **Change it.** Learn **video editing, public speaking, or teach online.** Open a notebook: **List your strengths, weaknesses, and ways to make money in 3 months.** Pick one and **start today.**

üí∞ **Quick Money-Making Ideas:**

* **Post celebrity clips** \+ commentary ‚Üí monetize.
* **Start an English-speaking channel** ‚Äì mirror practice ‚Üí upload.
* **Teach your graduation subjects** ‚Äì someone needs your knowledge.

**Every morning, write 3 money-making actions and execute.** No overthinking. **Just action.**

# Step 3: Your Body Controls Your Mind

Feeling weak? Hit the gym. Lift heavy. Do home workouts. **A strong body = a strong mind.**

ü•© **Eat like a warrior** ‚Äì Cut junk, eat protein, get sunlight.  
üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Move daily** ‚Äì Walk for 15 minutes. Reset your mind.  
üí™ **Push your limits** ‚Äì Hold a 30-sec plank. Increase daily.

# Step 4: Destroy Excuses ‚Äì No One Cares

Therapists won‚Äôt fix you. Pills won‚Äôt fix you. **Only action fixes you.**

**Right now:**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ Write your 3 biggest excuses.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Look in the mirror and say: **""I refuse to let these control me.""**  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Rip up the list. **Do something productive immediately.**

üí• **Procrastinating?** **Set a 5-minute timer and just start.** The hardest part is step one.

# Step 5: The Warrior‚Äôs Lifestyle ‚Äì Stay Unbreakable

Discipline makes you untouchable. Build habits that force growth:  
‚è∞ Wake up early.  
üèãÔ∏è Train hard.  
üíº Work relentlessly.  
üö´ Cut distractions.

**Before you sleep:** Write **3 things to accomplish tomorrow.** When you wake up, **execute.** Feel resistance? **Count down from 3 and move.**

# Final Words: Choose Power or Stay Weak

Depression is **weakness leaving your body.** You have two choices:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Sit in misery.**  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Take action and destroy it.**

Stand up. **Stretch.** Say: **""I control my life.""** Now, do something:

Last september i lost everything, i had a wife that left me and two cats that were like children to me (wich she took in the divorce), all because i had a damn suicidal crisis. 

We had so many dreams and she knew i was suicidal she knew of the depths of my depression, and yet she chose to inflict all this pain. She gave up on our promisses, to fight side by side against the world, that no matter what we would still be together.

We were living in Europe at the time, we had finally done it! Escaped our third world country. This was our dream. How could she destroy everything?

Now i'm left alone to pick up the pieces, had to move back to my god forsaken country, and i have to learn how to dream again. Europe was my dream before it was hers and i won't give it up. I'm trying, sending out my CV as much as i can, because in leaving me she cost me a great job as well.

I can't get over how much i hate her, how much she destroyed and how much i still love our little family despite it all.

I just want this to end, this pain, i wish there was a voluntary way for me to KMS without pain, without stigma. Just go you know? My life is already a ruin and her and our cats were the only reasons keeping me here.

I can't keep going like this, not in the ruins of what my dreams once were. And i know i can't rebuild. I'm too weak, too emotional, too broken.

I don‚Äôt even know where to start, but I just need to let this out.

I‚Äôve spent most of my life trying to be the person my family wanted me to be. I never even wanted to study architecture, but I did it because it was my father‚Äôs dream. I pushed through, studied, worked, and even opened my own office. But no matter what I do, it‚Äôs never enough. They‚Äôve told me multiple times that I‚Äôm not cut out for this field, that I lack the capability. My own family questions my worth, my ability.

For two years, I didn‚Äôt work a traditional job, but I wasn‚Äôt sitting idle either. I handled responsibilities nobody saw‚Äîdealing with court cases, making sure my family wasn‚Äôt stressed, standing by them through everything. I was there when my father had a hernia, when he got COVID, and when a heart attack followed. I took care of things without ever making them feel like a burden. And still, I get told that I‚Äôve done nothing.

I lost ‚Çπ25,000 in trading, and instead of seeing it as a lesson, my father sees it as proof that I‚Äôm a failure. Every decision I make, every step I take, is questioned. There‚Äôs always something I didn‚Äôt do right. Every time I try to stand up, life knocks me back down.

I have struggled with anxiety for years. I had dizziness episodes while working in Pune, to the point where I thought something was seriously wrong with me. I‚Äôve had heart palpitations, chest pain, and every symptom that made me think I was dying. But it was just anxiety, just my mind eating me alive.

I‚Äôve been through narcissistic parenting. That‚Äôs something I realized in therapy. The constant control, the guilt-tripping, the need to prove my worth over and over again‚Äîit messes with you. It makes you question yourself even when you know you‚Äôre doing the right thing. It drains you.

I had a relationship in the past that messed me up. I cared deeply, but it ended, and she moved on. I told another girl I had feelings for her, only to be met with silence for months before a simple ‚Äúsorry, I don‚Äôt want to bother.‚Äù And that was it. No closure, no nothing. Just left hanging. Now, I don‚Äôt even know if I want to open up to someone again. And maybe it‚Äôs stupid, but I never went around looking for distractions. I‚Äôm still a virgin, not because of some moral choice, but because I always believed in love, in something real. But all I‚Äôve gotten in return is heartbreak and disappointment.

And no, I don‚Äôt drink, I don‚Äôt smoke, I don‚Äôt get high to cope. But I still fell into the most destructive habit of them all‚Äîone that wrecked me physically and mentally. Masturbation became my escape, my crutch, my self-punishment. I‚Äôve done it thousands of times in my life, and I can feel how it has drained me. And I hate it, but it became the only thing I had control over.

I know people have had worse lives. I know I should be grateful. But I just feel exhausted. At 26, I should feel like I‚Äôm building something, like I have a purpose. Instead, I feel like I‚Äôm standing in the ruins of something I never even wanted to build in the first place.

I don‚Äôt know if this post will help. Maybe I just needed to write it down. Maybe someone out there feels the same.",young midlife crisis old start dont even know start need let ive spent life trying person family wanted never even wanted study architecture fathers dream pushed studied worked even opened office matter never enough theyve told multiple times im cut field lack capability family questions worth ability two years didnt work traditional job wasnt sitting idle either handled responsibilities nobody sawdealing court cases making sure family wasnt stressed standing everything father hernia got covid heart attack followed took care things without ever making feel like burden still get told ive done nothing lost 25000 trading instead seeing lesson father sees proof im failure every decision make every step take questioned theres always something didnt right every time try stand life knocks back struggled anxiety years dizziness episodes working pune point thought something seriously wrong ive heart palpitations chest pain every symptom made think dying anxiety mind eating alive ive narcissistic parenting thats something realized therapy constant control guilttripping need prove worth againit messes makes question even know youre right thing drains relationship past messed cared deeply ended moved told another girl feelings met silence months simple sorry dont want bother closure nothing left hanging dont even know want open someone maybe stupid never went around looking distractions im still virgin moral choice always believed love something real ive gotten return heartbreak disappointment dont drink dont smoke dont get high cope still fell destructive habit allone wrecked physically mentally masturbation became escape crutch selfpunishment ive done thousands times life feel drained hate became thing control know people worse lives know grateful feel exhausted 26 feel like im building something like purpose instead feel like im standing ruins something never even wanted build first place dont know post help maybe needed write maybe someone feels,1,2,0,Neutral,Low,[],[]

Hi everyone,
I‚Äôm really struggling right now and would appreciate any support or advice.

My boyfriend (6 months together) has been showing signs of depression for a while. He‚Äôs also grieving the loss of his best friend, which hit him very hard. In the beginning, our relationship was full of love, affection, and emotional closeness. He often told me how safe he felt with me, how much I meant to him, and how I helped him feel better ‚Äî even during hard moments.

Over the past few weeks, he started pulling away. He was more distant, less responsive, sometimes affectionate, but also cold or flat. It felt very confusing. He told me he was ‚Äúacting weird‚Äù and I could feel his guilt ‚Äî like he knew he was hurting me but didn‚Äôt know how to stop it.

Now, for the past few days, he‚Äôs gone completely silent. He read my last message (which was kind and gentle), but hasn‚Äôt responded. He asked me before to stop messaging, and I respected that, but I‚Äôm scared. I don‚Äôt want him to feel like I‚Äôm abandoning him, especially now.

I know he‚Äôs not well. I know he probably misses me too ‚Äî he just doesn‚Äôt know how to handle love right now. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. Should I keep giving him space? Should I check in? I‚Äôm not angry, I just don‚Äôt want him to feel alone.

My bf of a year is going through hell at the moment. Without being too personal, his ex wife is making his life hell, work doesn't pay well and his manager is on his case all the time, grief, car problems, financial problems, health problems. It doesn't end.  
He's told me he's severely depressed.  
I've tried to be a supportive partner but he needs a lot of space. He's irritable, snappy, short. Has no desire to do anything. When I talk to him, or try to, it always turn into some kind of fight. Or he will say he doesn't have the patience for it.

The past few days have been really rough for him. His ex wife forbid him from seeing his children and he spiralled.  
I talked to him, and he told me he wasn't in the mood to talk to anyone. So I gave him the space he asked for.  
Two days later I reconnected with him. He spiralled and accused me of giving him the silent treatment. I explained that it wasn't the case and he accused me of gas-lighting him.  
During the day, he started multiple micro fights over anything and everything. Everything I said, turned into a mini fight.  
Responding, another mini fight. I felt like I couldn't win no matter what I did or say. At the end of the day, he told me I wasn't taking accountability and he felt like I wasn't listening to him.

So I stopped answering to his messages, I was drained. He showed up at my apartment that night and he apologized. Held me and he cried. We talked and we decided to stay together.

After that day, he said he wasn't sure about us anymore. That I wasn't a good partner. 

When we started dating, he told me he's the kind of person to self sabotage and that if our relationship were to turn to shit, it would be his fault.

I can tell right now he's in self sabotage mode. Pushing people away. Especially me who is the closest to him.

I can also tell he's spiralling and want to be loved. But that I'm doing is contributing to his depression.

Expectation, a word I can throw around casually, yet an idea that dictates my every decision. I convince myself that I'm doing things right, or that I'm paving my way to success. But am I, no matter how well I think I do it's never enough to rip out this parasite of a feeling thats always weighing me down, like a hunger I can never satisfy, a feeling of emptiness deep in my stomach and the back of my subconscious that tells me its never enough. Its a feeling that holds me down, an expectation, I feel like im constantly staring at myself, telling myself im not good enough no matter what praise or affection I get. Is this feeling one cast by my own eyes whenever I look into a mirror, or shame I feel every time those important to me look into my eyes, I know that im ugly, lazy, selfish, two faced, a horrible friend, an introvert, unmotivated, depressed, angry, addicted, and fake. Yet it‚Äôs as if my heart cant handle it and my mind creates falsehoods to tell me im good enough, I lie to myself and to friends pretending that im something im not, I derive satisfaction from the way others people perceive me and that alone, yet somehow the way I see myself overpowers what anyone tells me. I always feel deep down that no matter who it is that they secretly think negative things of me. I can‚Äôt help but feeling empty, it never improves, never gets better, it only gets worse every time someone tells me things that I want to hear yet im not ready for. How many friendships, how many things do I have to do wrong before the motivation to improve hits my ears. How many times do I have to betray myself and corrupt my morals until I feel satisfied with the image in my mirror. I cant stand to look at myself. I tell myself im happy, that im content, and I‚Äôve gotten pretty good at feining my mental state infront of people. I smile, yet It‚Äôs always a mask, to pretend that im something im not. I hate myself, I truly cant say theres a single thing that I like about myself. I‚Äôm stuck, I keep coming back to my pond the second I catch a view of the ocean.

A moment in time where I dont have to be myself, or I can confide in the fact that im not truly happy. I keep betraying people to try and pull myself out of the pit of dissatisfaction im in. Even in moments where the consequences have no comparable worth to what ill lose I take it. I'm drowning, chained down by the subconscious image I make of myself. I need a life raft, even one that will sink shortly after. I get stuck in moments, whether I think it or not my minds always begging someone for help. If I even get a hint of affection I lose my moral compass. I look for a way to take that life raft so I can save myself the burden of losing myself to my emotions. I‚Äôve ruined far too many friendships with my mentality.

My husband has been on a constant downward spiral mentally since just before our first loss; loss of interest, increasing loss of appetite, increasingly frequent and intense emotional breakdowns (crying, screaming, begging, etc.), fatigue, chronic anxiety, paranoia, self-sabatoge, etc. He tried therapy two years ago when I found a therapist for my depression and chronic anxiety, but found no solace or support in her. He thinks the concept of finding another therapist would be pointless. He has lost several friends the last year or two and he feels like every relationship he has except for ours is shallow, like he can't rely on literally anyone because no one cares. We are incredibly close-knit and any attempt to try to break him of this co-dependency leads to him having a panicky breakdown, certain I'm leaving him or don't love him. I'm pregnant now and I simply can't support him to the degree he needs - in fact, my mood swings are so bad that I snap at him before I can stop myself when he is in his low lows.

1jie8dd,2025-03-24T01:29:30,"Am I really depressed or just being lazy and exaggerative?
I don't know if this is the right sub to go to but at this point I don't have many options. 

I have been feeling being ""depressed"" lately. When I say lately I mean for a couple of months I think. I've lost track of it. I think my situation is sort of uncommon. As of writting this, I am in my first year of college and still live with my parents. However, my parents are ""seperated"" (not divorced, they never married) and we still live in the same household along with my 2 sisters. One is in 5th grade and the other is in special education 3rd grade. Everyday is full of stress, as my father every now and then ignores my mother in matters for my sister. Also, he has put my mother in over thousands of dollars in financial debt because he stole her information to open credit cards. Recently, the court agreed that my mother has weekdays and my father has weekends. My father is out of the state for 3 weeks straight for his work and has put the stress of taking care of my sisters on my mother and I. Keep in mind, she does not have a job due to her taking care of my sisters and dropping me off to college. (My dad has done many other things to my mom, but that would be 2 paragraphs on its own)

I can't do this anymore, it been since my birth they were together, not together, together, and not together again. I feel like a burden, I don't take care of my hygene as often anymore, my college work is falling behind, I can't keep up with my room, I haven't changed my bedsheets in months, I haven't brushed in weeks, I eat like I am starving, then I eat like I'm full all the time, I hate that I talk to my mom like my dad, I hate I don't wake up on time for college which makes my mom late for her classes, I don't help around the house because my bum ass is lazy, my sleep schedule is abismal. I feel like nothing is real, but maybe because I don't get much sleep.

Yes, I have been thinking about SH, and its very vivid. With the amount of stress my mom deals with, I don't want to talk about this with her. And if I tell a professional about this, they might admit me to somewhere and get my mom and I into more debt and I fall behind more on other things. However, because of this she gives me talks about how im lazy and need to treat my college like a job and ""no wonder you're failing math with the amount you sleep like that."" She says these types of things alot, and I think she might be right. Maybe I am just lazy, maybe I am taking it too far and its just a ""cop out"" to stop doing my responsibilties. Another reason I think im just being lazy is that when I'm at campus, I am the opposite of this. I am friendly and chill, I laugh and have a good time. I still love to play videogames as its one of the few things that still give me joy. Am I just pretending? Am I not depressed becuase I am a bit self aware and still have hobbies?

1ji7b0n,2025-03-23T20:21:43,"Anyone Know How To Start Recuperating From Long Periods of Depression?
My first depression happened in about 2010. Since then I've had periods of severe depression, periods of light depression and periods where I wasn't depressed.

I think I'm currently in the longest unbroken period of depression though. Started in 2020 as severe depression, turned into light depression at the end of 2022, and then turned back into severe depression at the end of 2023 and has been severe ever since.

Anyway, I say all this because I've also recovered from depression several times now. But I feel like each time I've done it, it has been harder than before. Taken more effort and it has been harder to make that effort.

At this point, like 6 depressions in and after being consistently depressed for like 4 years, I feel like I literally just no longer have the energy to get out of it. A lot of the time I just feel like I can't do anything else except passively accept my circumstances. Because I no longer believe it can get better, and I just don't have the energy left to recover.

It's like periods of drought. You can store up water and food for when a drought hits. But each drought you have to use some. And if a lot of droughts happen one after the other or last very long, the storage spaces for the water and food are gonna be drained. And so how do you survive then? How do you recover?

I feel like I'm at that point nowadays. And I'm not sure how I can change it.

Since this depressive episode been dragging on for years, feels like my brain‚Äôs fried. My mind‚Äôs always foggy, memory‚Äôs trash, and sometimes even forming a sentence feels like a damn struggle. I know depression itself can do that, but could smoking be making it worse? I read somewhere that it messes with o2 flow to the brain, weakens neurons, and slows down thinking, but no clue if that‚Äôs real or just more bs theories.

Tbh when it comes to mental health, I lost faith in docs and all that traditional treatment shit. My experience with antidepressants was a disaster, and at this point, I trust real ppl‚Äôs experiences way more than whatever new study they push every few months.

So how true is it that smoking actually makes depression symptoms worse, like brain fog and focus issues? Cuz if that‚Äôs legit, I might need to rethink some things.

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: NSFW!!! Read at your own risk.


ALL OF THIS I‚ÄôM EXPLAINING IS TRUE. I just know it is. And if I did anything extremely wrong. Please advise that I am a fully changed person and I don‚Äôt do that type of stuff anymore.

Please provide me support & forgive me for all my past. And make me help move on. üôèüèª Please be nice to me. Everyone is so mean to me (including my parents) recently, and it‚Äôs been really difficult to get better & it‚Äôs also hard to get over it. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π 

My father just abused me a few weeks ago & it‚Äôs very hard for me to move on from it. Also, I‚Äôm being transitioned into a new school. AGAIN!!!!! And I was already transitioned into a different school once & it‚Äôs happening again.

Many years ago, back in 2022/2023. I made an inappropriate joke about Nurse Bendy (from Moral Orel) calling her sexy & hot. I moved on from this. Please don‚Äôt get mad at me. This was a long time ago.

Someone doxxed my face, and people also made fun of me in a severely hurtful way. They‚Äôve also made fun of me & also said something beyond NSFW about me that I cannot say on this subreddit.

I highly advise you to NOT look it up of what I‚Äôm talking about, and about Nurse Bendy. This is extremely serious.

They‚Äôve also been using a lot of harsh language to me.

I‚Äôve been having so many suicidal thoughts recently. There‚Äôs also a kid named Michael who hates me & always insulted me in a severely terrible way. There was also this one time where a group of guys on the street called me a lot of racist things & disgustingly awful things to me.

And there‚Äôs this one time where I got my legs kicked at the lunchroom by a girl named Angie & everyone laughed at me. I started crying. Literally.

Oh, and there‚Äôs this one time where I got insulted outside my old school, and he called me a ‚Äúbig a** forehead‚Äù which I don‚Äôt. Because I said to him that he says too much curse words (which is true, honestly.) and my crush Kaylee was sitting next to him. Which made me mad.

I got so frustrated at the fact that my crush Kaylee was gay. And despite being homeschooled, I still sent an apology letter that I was sorry for being a creep to her. I just didn‚Äôt know how to flirt with a girl.


My mom says that she‚Äôll protect me. No matter the cost.


And that was all of it. I‚Äôm already grown now. So that happened back in the early 2020s, and the worst thing they could call me was a ‚Äúman-child‚Äù. I am also even worse than Charlie Brown.

Everyone thinks I‚Äôm doing well. I‚Äôm pretty and charismatic.

Hi Guys, as the title says, I am looking for 3 people with depression, who do not have a trigger in their environment (just lost a job, partner left etc), but suspect, it might come from their body. Of course we all have our problems and life is tough, but I am looking specifically for individuals who have been depressed since a long time and can't really figure out why. 

I am a nutritionist and have great results with treating depression through nutrition and lifestyle changes. I also include trauma and nervous system work, but mostly concentrate on the body, because 80% of serotonin is made in the gut and the microbiome plays a HUGE role. 

So I am looking for 3 individuals who are willing to work with me for a few months. You don't have to pay me, but if you have good results, please recommend me to others. 

You don't have to buy supplements from me (you might need some stuff, but can get that wherever it is convenient), but you might have to do some testing (blood, urine, stool) and be willing to give any diet changes your all and be serious about it (no worries, you will be well fed and taken care of).

we are going to have one/two appointments each month, maybe even in a group call and hopefully get you out of the darkness, into the light.

1jh0mm5,2025-03-22T05:37:06,"Depressed boyfriend turned toxic and I need to know if its normal
My boyfriend is battling depression. He has zero energy for any kind of social interaction. He doesn't want to work. Sleeps a lot. Is pushing me away when I want to help or stonewalling me.

His ex took him to court for a custody battle that is draining him emotionally and financially. She's forbidding him to see his kids. It's been difficult for him.

One thing about me and my bf, I've always told him he could be himself around me. No mask, no fakeness, just him communicating his feelings. 

Lately he's been toxic and projecting those emotions onto me.
The caring man he used to be is now rude to me.
Yesterday something happened and I called him. He told me to let him know the outcome of my misadventures the next day, that's today.

I texted him, asking if he was free for a call so I call and tell him what happened. He replied: Do I really give off the vibe right now that I want to talk with you? That's a serious question. I didn't reply.

Last week, we were talking and he was his usual sweet man. He told me he couldn't wait to see me. Said I love you. Really made me feel better.

Earlier this week I asked him what he wanted to do, he got upset saying he didn't remember saying we should hang out and told me I was making him feel crazy.
But two hours later he apologized, saying work is stressful and he's gonna make time for me.

When I was over to his place, he was sweet for an hour and then he out of nowhere started an argument about plans we made and he called me toxic for reminding him of the conversation we had. Asked me why I was at his house to spend time with him. 

Sometimes I will ask him what he's up to at night and he'll say things like: Being extremely uninterested in having a conversation.
Or Why are you trying to force a conversation?

Before being depressed he was never this rude to me. Ever.

Tonight, in the span on 5 mins, he told me he didn't wanna talk to me. When I didn't reply he went hello???? And 3 mins later: Amazing communication! This is why I push you away!!


I've been depressed myself before but I never projected my emotions like that or turned mean towards the person I love the most.

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being overprotective, controlling, or just a brother who cares too much. But I think I messed up, and now my sister is distancing herself from me.

I‚Äôm 24M, and my sister is 21F. We used to be really close, but things changed in the past few months. She had a 3-month relationship, and after the breakup, she started having anxiety attacks. I was the one who supported her, and she told me she wouldn't date again. But now, she‚Äôs secretly chatting with someone again.

She hides her chats, deletes messages, and acts differently when I‚Äôm around. I tried talking to her and told her that she‚Äôs free to do whatever she wants, but I don‚Äôt want her dating again, at least not now. I reminded her of her past experience, but she just said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my life, my choice.‚Äù That hit me hard.

But here‚Äôs the thing‚ÄîI‚Äôm not innocent in all this. I used to be overly protective, and yeah, I even invaded her privacy. I kept an eye on her, checked who she was talking to, and I‚Äôve even tried hacking into networks to see her messages (which didn‚Äôt work). I thought I was doing it to protect her, but now I see how it must have felt like I was spying on her.

Now, she‚Äôs avoiding me. Today, we were sitting with our relatives, and the moment they left the room, she left too‚Äîon purpose. She doesn‚Äôt even ask me simple things like what to bring from outside when my dad tells her to check with everyone.

What hurts me even more is that whenever I ask her ""When will we talk?"", she just says ""We'll see"" and avoids answering directly. No matter what I ask, her response is always ""We'll see."" It feels like she doesn‚Äôt care anymore, or maybe she‚Äôs waiting for me to stop asking.

And the worst part? She‚Äôs not forgiving me. I‚Äôve apologized, I‚Äôve tried to talk things out, but she straight-up told me to ""stay away"" for now. It‚Äôs like she wants nothing to do with me.

I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs just mad at me, or if I‚Äôve permanently damaged our bond. I know I made mistakes, but I did it out of concern.

At the same time, I‚Äôm dealing with my own problems‚Äîcareer uncertainty, health issues, and depression since I was 18. Everything feels messed up. I even started smoking again from the stress.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. Should I distance myself? Apologize again? Or just let things be? I feel like I‚Äôve lost my sister, and I don‚Äôt know how to fix it.

1jgqicq,2025-03-21T21:21:02,"Am I depressed? Or neurodivergent?
I (23F) have always been a glass half-empty sort of person for as long as I can remember. I lack emotions and interest in things. For the past year or so, I believe this has increased. 

A bit of background: 

I‚Äôve been aloof from my emotions ever since I was a child, perhaps this has something to do with my overly critical parents. I was (and am) an overachiever and people always have high expectations from me, which feels so trapping. I also suffer from self doubt and low confidence. This might be a good place to mention my parents have had poor health since forever, which adds to the pressure. 

I have been suicidal in the past during the time I was preparing for medical entrance exams, but that corrected itself once I cleared the exams.

I don‚Äôt have a great relationship with my parents, even now. I am the golden child/trophy child. While it does feel great to be bragged about, it sucks to know they know nothing about me as a person. 

Currently: 

I feel no interest in things. I don‚Äôt find the energy to do/try new things. I can‚Äôt seem to find the energy to socialise. I find it hard to make new friends. I can‚Äôt seem to find the energy to do special things for my loved ones. I don‚Äôt want to learn new things. I don‚Äôt want to think about anything. 
I‚Äôve even lost my sense of humour.

I feel like I am 80 years old, even though I am really not this boring. 

I am not suicidal, and I don‚Äôt hate myself or my life, but I just can‚Äôt seem to be bothered to do anything. Like, absolutely anything. It‚Äôs almost like I am living on autopilot. 

I was wondering was this means? And what do you think I should do here on out?

Heya all, 27, been depressed since around 12 or 13 and it just never went away. 

I'm moving out soon entirely by myself so will need to handle everything without the help of another person / people. 

The things I struggle the most with are cleaning. On those days or weeks where you just are trying to get through the day, cleaning is your last thought. However, living in an unclean environment just makes you even more depressed. It's a vicious cycle.

What are your tips for making chores and adulting as easy as possible? I live a very simple life already because it helps me mentally, but I know there are improvements and simplifications I can make that would make things just a little easier. 

It could be gadgets, techniques, schedules, anything that has made your life easier and reduced the burden of adulting.

1jg3rlg,2025-03-21T01:06:29,"parasocial attachment to a fictional character has ruined my life
hi, im currently a teen (16f) in highschool and last year, i found a youtube video about this video game character. i didnt know about this game or this character beforehand, but they come from a really popular game apparently.

after doing some research, looking into their lore, even reading fanfics about them, i found myself completely attached over a matter of days. i found myself completely in love with him physically and emotionally. i basically know  everything about them. 

but for some reason, after seeing more and more content about him, i started to feel this sort of anxious, depressed, and maybe even suicidal feeling. i realized that he isn‚Äôt real, and he never will be able to love me. i won‚Äôt be able to live in his ‚Äúuniverse‚Äù and experience myself in his life because it‚Äôs just not possible. it hurt. and it caused me to spiral into a depressive episode in which i genuinely thought about killing myself because it hurt so much. i know it‚Äôs psychotic and stupid, and incredibly farfetched and crazy. but it‚Äôs how i felt. i was truly in so much pain. and i couldn‚Äôt tell anyone because i knew nobody would understand.

i began avoiding everything about the character. the video game they come from, the things about them, everything. even one small mention even remotely close to him would make my heart sink and ruin my day. i always think that he‚Äôs watching me too. watching me go to school, watching me eat, everything. i‚Äôm still so paranoid and obsessed with him, even though ive tried to remove this character from my online world. 

and ive tried therapy. ive tried to journal, workout, eat healthy, go on walks, limit screen time, read, do hobbies. ive done research on how to heal. and i havent. i still feel the same. i even have good friends in which i hang out with, and talk to in school regularly. i do my homework. everything. and still, he will not leave my mind. and every little thing reminds me of him. ive even tried asking chatgpt for gods sake üò≠ and still, im attached, and everytime i think about him i am filled with depression and anxiety because i know that he won‚Äôt ever be with me. i have no idea what to do. it‚Äôs gotten so bad that i can‚Äôt imagine myself being in a real relationship because i‚Äôm scared they‚Äôll play the game in which he comes from and i‚Äôll become depressed all over again. that, and the fact that i don‚Äôt want anyone else but him. 

i don‚Äôt know what to do. please tell me there‚Äôs someone here who‚Äôs going through or has gone through something similar. im willing to give out my socials to people that want to help. i just want to be okay. please somebody help. i would also appreciate if there was no judgement either as this was one of the only places i felt safe enough to share. thank you for taking the time to read.

1jfz4tg,2025-03-20T21:44:44,"Don't care about much these days...
Ive been depressed most of my life, but slowly inch by inch it feel like its been getting worse rather than better. Really I live quite a blessed life, my family has money and I am dual citizen which has allowed me to see a lot in my life....But yet I am often followed by a dark cloud of sadness. 

I would say my main issues are the following; 
1st: I feel very alone, being very different has made it a struggle for me to connect with others. Sometimes I just think I operate on a completely different hardware compared to the adverage person. Like why is everyone so upsessed with status and money? Anyways I digress... having hardly any family near me most of my life has brought issolation, moving so often means I don't have much of a community/foundation. Even when I was a kid I was the lone wolf, making up imaginary friends rather than hanging with buddies. (Friends for me was just a TV show) And yes I'm an only child too. (I'm now a 30 year old male just FYI who has lived half my life in the US and half in Europe. Just about every 10 years I moved somewhere else)
2nd: I don't feel I have a purpose. I have had many talents and interest in many things over my life, but nothing that I have felt is my soul purpose, or  I should say I haven't found a way to make a living off of it (I'm the artist type) I work part time gigs to get by, but I always saw a job as a chore.
3rd and final: Why are we here on this Earth? We are born on this planet without any idea of why or any recollection as to if this was even a conscious choice to incarnate. I have been digging deep into spirituality, reading Alan Watts and Eckart Tolle, speaking with a Guru type guide which is telling me we are all connected to God, that we are all just an extension of collective consciousness. That my ego and all I know is essentially an illusion and I'm just along for the ride...I don't know but it all just seems so pointless... Why go on and continue this experience at all? 8 billion people on earth, I think collective consciousness can go on with 1 less. I mean coming down to this planet without any knowledge as to why?! 

Life is hard for everyone at times, and we all have to come up with reasons as to why its worth living, but I REALLY struggle to come up with those reasons...some might say enjoy the little things, enjoy food for example. (People seem upsessed with food here on earth) fuck I see food as just another chore I have to do to continue on. If I never had to eat again I would see it as a postive. Again I know I'm weird. 

Well... I know I'm ranting but I thought this would be a more interesting experience than just writing it down in my journal. If anyone relates I am happy to hear any advice or any relatable stories if you feel like sharing.

Every day, I wake up and go to the hospital. I‚Äôve consulted every department‚Äîoncology, dermatology, urology‚Äîmultiple hospitals, multiple doctors. They all say it‚Äôs just anxiety, but I can‚Äôt stop. Even a small scratch makes me think I‚Äôll lose my leg. My biggest fear now? Penile amputation.

For 10 years, I‚Äôve had extreme masturbation addiction (10-20 times a day). In 2022, I developed erectile dysfunction, and now I think my penis has a curve (possible Peyronie‚Äôs disease).

Doctors dismiss it, but are they just assuming I‚Äôm paranoid? They only did a physical exam‚Äîshouldn‚Äôt I do a Penile Doppler Test to be sure?

I‚Äôve been wasting my parents‚Äô money on constant hospital visits since 2020. They‚Äôre frustrated. I have no social life‚Äîstuck inside my room for years. My lifestyle is a mess. I chain-smoke (two packs a day), eat junk food, barely move, and have no motivation. I tried therapy, took anxiety meds, but couldn‚Äôt continue. Gym lasted three months before I kept getting injured. I‚Äôm studying for my degree from home, but my exams are in two months, and I haven‚Äôt studied a word. My mind is consumed by health anxiety.

I know my anxiety didn‚Äôt start overnight. My dad was extremely anxious too, and he used to hit me a lot until 10th grade. I started hitting my mom, and the cycle continued. We don‚Äôt talk anymore, but I still lash out at her. Outside my home, I‚Äôm a normal, kind person‚Äîbut at home, I become someone I hate.

Then there‚Äôs love. When I was dating my ex, that was the happiest time of my life. My anxiety was still there, but my lust almost disappeared. I truly loved her‚Äîwithout even thinking sexually. But in the end, she cheated on me and ruined me. I still think about her a year later. Can love heal me? Or am I just desperate for affection? Would a social life help? After high school, I never went to a regular college, and I‚Äôve been isolated ever since. Is that why my mental health is so bad?

My anxiety started when I was 18, after my first sexual experience with a prostitute. I got obsessive about STDs, kept getting tested for a year (all negative), and that‚Äôs when my hospital addiction began. Did that experience break me? Or is my childhood trauma the root of it? A psychiatrist said even small substance use (weed, synthetic drugs) can alter the brain, but is that really the cause?

I‚Äôm exhausted. I just want peace. I want to sit on a beach, feel the breeze, drink lemonade, and relax. But my mind won‚Äôt let me. It keeps telling me I‚Äôll lose my penis, that I‚Äôll wake up to a disaster tomorrow. How do I break this cycle? I have exams in two months‚Äîhow do I even focus when I haven‚Äôt studied a word?

Of course, there‚Äôs more to the story, including her turning off the emergency bypass ringtone (which was her idea to have in the first place) and texting me when I nearly pulled up to the venue that she was home safe, but those are the highlights

I would really appreciate your advice

I (20F) have been with this guy for a year in the first year of uni (we were exclusive). We did everything couples would do, cook together, shower together, sleep together. I did everything for him, packed him lunch and washed his clothes(I know how pathetic). 

After one year he still didn‚Äôt ask me to be his girlfriend but I loved him so I stayed, then he left me cus he wanted to be independent and alone. My mental health was so bad during that time and I got diagnosed with complex PTSD/Borderline Personality Disorder. I have abandonment issues and problems with my dad. 

I have been in long term relationships since a young age and I have never been alone for long/single. I decided to move in campus to a college to experience uni life (first year i lived off campus alone but he slept over at mine everyday so we were really close). He knew I was moving on campus for better mental health. 

But one month after he left me to be ‚Äúindependent‚Äù I see his location is at my accomodation and it turns out he‚Äôs seeing someone in my new college building. I see them together all the time during dinner and breakfast knowing that they slept together, or hearing their friends in the halls talk about it (he doesn‚Äôt live in my college but in another college across the road, he‚Äôs always here though). 

Seeing them really triggers my bad BPD tendencies and I start comparing myself to her a lot (I have very low self esteem) then go into a spiral. After finding out he‚Äôs seeing someone in my college it was bad, i had to start antipsychotics and go on stronger antidepressants. I just don‚Äôt know what to do with myself. I have exams and ai know I should be locking in but I can‚Äôt even do that because I‚Äôm so heartbroken and I‚Äôm in so much pain and hurt seeing them together. 


I would really appreciate your advice on how to move on, heal my heart, learn that he‚Äôs not worth it (he treated me with barely any respect and i felt like he was using me for food, sex, and like affection). I just want to learn how to be okay and love myself cus I hate myself. I‚Äôm so sad, I love him so much. I‚Äôm sorry this is so long, I‚Äôm trying to get therapy but it‚Äôs hard to.

Hello everyone,

I am going through a very difficult period in my life again. I no longer know exactly who I am or what I can do.

I am an 18-year-old male, currently in higher education. I wake up early every day to return late in the evening. I am preparing for my driving license. I have someone in my life. I live with my grandparents. And each day can be quite good or feel like total hell.

Recently, I have seriously thought about committing suicide in different ways. I feel like I want to escape my life at all costs. I feel sick and weak every day.

Lately, I have started to feel strange sensations that deeply disturb me. I am someone who does not believe in God, who believes in nothing except science. Nevertheless, I feel like something evil is within me. Something that terrifies me, something that imposes dark thoughts on me, something that causes panic attacks.

I no longer know what to think about all this. And I am not taking drugs at the moment, because yes, I am strongly considering it.

Recently, I have started hearing a very stressful rhythm in my head. Very stressful. And it occurs randomly, like my panic attacks and dark thoughts. A headache also overwhelms me very intensely during these moments. And I am very afraid of it.

I feel like I am harming everyone who comes close to my circle. I sometimes think I deserve to be hated by these people, and I sincerely hope, deep down, that they are better off, away from the terrible person I can be.

I am tired. I have no answers; going to school has become hard to bear.

And if you are reading this message, don‚Äôt think about me anymore, block me, don‚Äôt meddle in my life, you don‚Äôt deserve this. Fly away from me, leave me where I must heal or let myself die.

1je08ys,2025-03-18T09:30:07,"Severe depression and reoccurring suicidal thoughts
24m here. I‚Äôve been depressed my whole life, as long as I can remember. I had a really rough childhood, parents were on drugs real bad, molested a lot as a kid, beat by my stepdad and sexually abused by him. My step dad also would kill our animals when he got angry. It was really traumatizing and I also struggle with my sexuality, and can‚Äôt open up to anyone, and have crippling anxiety that causes high blood pressure and high heart rate. I‚Äôve experienced so much as a kid that no kid should have to go through. I know I‚Äôm 24 but sometimes I still feel like that 5 year old boy who just wants his mommy. My dad died when I was 14 from drinking and driving a day after he told me it was my fault that he started drinking again(because of my sexuality). And that fucking kills me. My siblings won‚Äôt grow up with a father because of me. My mom was on drugs my whole life and was diagnosed bipolar schizophrenic. She would say some of the meanest things to me. And treated me like absolute shit.  I cut her out of my life until December of 2023 when she got diagnose with chronic myeloid leukemia, blast crisis. She got really sick and actually sobered up because she was too weak to do drugs and was bedridden, but her moods still will switch like crazy and she‚Äôd accuse me of trying to poison or kill her. It was hard because she seemed like she was doing better til she wasn‚Äôt. I had to be the one to put her on hospice care and she hated me for it but she was suffering. Whenever she started to pass I couldn‚Äôt hold her hand or come near her even though she was looking at me unable to talk. But I was honestly just scared to. I can‚Äôt let myself process my feelings and I don‚Äôt know why. But she passed in April of 2024 and it was really hard on me. Now both of my parents are gone. I feel so alone in this cruel world. I do have amazing friends but I‚Äôm so insecure and can‚Äôt open up completely to people. I feel like a complete weirdo. I moved to Texas from Georgia hoping a fresh start would be good for me but I feel like it was a temporary bandaid. The thoughts are back stronger than ever. I have all my affairs in order and have a plan just not a date. I‚Äôm just tired of feeling this way and I feel like I can‚Äôt do it anymore. My mental health has seriously deteriorated and declined over the past couple of years. I just want it to stop. I‚Äôm exhausted and tired of pretending I‚Äôm fine. I want to talk to my friends about it but I don‚Äôt want them to think I‚Äôm a problem or someone they don‚Äôt want to be around. I hate that my mind works this way. I‚Äôm just ready for peace.

Ive been diagnosed with depression since i was 17/18 and it has always come and go (currently 30) . And i dont know if its just me, or life stages. But ive tried everything. 

There are days or weeks or even years where life feels great and it feels great to be alive but then it comes with these depressive periods as well. And its not cause of some life tragedy that occurs but that sense of depression and lack of meaning that hits you like waves.

Life isnt fantastic by any means but neither is it bad enough to be depressed and i dont know why it keeps happening. I'm sometimes worried that somewhere down the road, it might hit me hard enough that i might be suicidal. 

Whenever i see news of celebrities committing suicide, especially those at a much older age, i can empathize with them and somehow, i can imagine they must have had similar thoughts as me at my current age and im worried that i'd reach that age where id feel suicidal. 

On times/periods i feel good, i always get anxious on when the next depressive episode might occur.

1jdt33m,2025-03-18T02:01:00,"I don't want to do anything. I'm sick of life.
Looooonnnnnnggggg story short, I had a less than four month old puppy who died from an illness and her sister who had the same thing (didnt know either had it until death) died under two weeks later and I never got a proper goodbye. This was fifth grade. It sounds like I'm overreacting but I'm not kidding. I was a pretty smart kid who was happy and then I moved, new school, everything, and then they died. I had no-one to talk to since we were just a few weeks in, and proceeded to switch classes once they got some info transferred. I was home alone. Holding a knife to my chest after months of grief, stress, loneliness, insecurity, and just being numb. I broke down when my pups came in through the doggy door and the thought of them being alone broke me. In 6th grade I felt a bit better, not completely, but wounds were healing and I had one close friend who has supported me. In 7th grade, it all got so much worse. I had cut my wrists, made vent art as an outlet (which make me feel the slightest better but not much), and wanted to die so many times again. When a girl I had been really close friends with for years called me racist (we had a chat where she would put in another language and the group asked her to stop-mind you i was learning this language-and she blew up at me calling me racist) and our friendship was over after a long argument. So many little things made me resent her even more after that too. I started isolating myself from people after getting into more fights-everything is always my fault ig-and went back to being *super* suicidal. I almost cried in classes from everything bubbling up inside me, started not being hungry and (already having body issues and wasn't eating lunch) went over 24 hours without any food. I just wasn't hungry, SO tired, lost motivation, forgot about anything for myself, and all I could think about was the suicidal thoughts in my head and I really wanted to kms. The stress, loneliness, trust issues i developed, constantly blaming myself, that girl (told my best friend that I was toxic but my bff just knew it wasn't true) was backstabbing, I got body shamed (reference: 5'4 125 lbs worked out a LOT so it was mainly muscle) and grew even more shattered and insecure, all led to a major decline in my mental health that I haven't recovered from and am still going through. Is this depression? Idk. Either way I hate my life and just can't get out of this hole. My friend reported me for cuts on my wrists so the counselor and my parents know but nothing they try is helping. My parents don't understand that i believe it's depression since they dont know about the suicidal part. It hasn't gotten better. How do i get out of this? At least make it better? I'm so confused. I just want to end it all. How do I escape?

1jdpryl,2025-03-17T23:28:31,"My life is hell
I am a 24 year old man. I suffer from severe depression, fatigue, severe anxiety, ADHD, OCD and am currently burned out.

First of all, I don't have anywhere where I feel good. If I'm not at my parents' house, I feel alone, and I'm not liked by my roommates because I don't have the codes of how to run a house.

When I'm at my mother's house, I'm harassed, she blames me for my so-called lack of effort all day, the fact that I don't work (and yet I would like so much!!), blackmails me, puts psychological pressure on me, etc. No matter how much I tell her that depression is a real illness, she doesn't listen to me. Also, I don't have a bedroom and I sleep in the living room. I am not intimidated and am always bothered.

Then as soon as I wake up, after 12 hours of sleep, I feel terrible, depressed and tired. I have 0 motivations for the day, even things that previously motivated me like dancing motivate me more and in any case I am too tired to take transport.

So I spend all day doing nothing and feeling bad. Nothing motivates me and I'm too exhausted to go out etc. I can barely cook, just boil rice.

And in the evening my mother comes back with her reproaches etc.

This every day without knowing when it will get better. Medication doesn't work, neither does therapy.

Every day I try to force myself immensely to take a small step forward (today I ordered a food supplement against depression).

1jdcr4r,2025-03-17T14:34:17,"My friend is struggling and I don't know what to do
Hello Redditors,
I (M 25) wanted to ask you guys how you would deal with the situation and how you would like to be treated. My friend (M 26) has been struggling with depression for years. Imo this is deeply linked to every aspect of his life so I will begin with a little background information.

We used to be very close since before kindergarden and grew gradually apart since primary school, even though our families are still close and I would consider myself still his closest. It always seemed to me and my family that he might be on the spectrum and struggled within social hierarchies and pressures. Additionally, he is really uninterested in many topics, yet he can talk for hours about his special interests.
This is obviously not to say that people on the spectrum all share these traits. He struggled in school while I didn't. Similarly he struggled finding new friends while I didn't.

Sadly he developed a major depression during the last years, being hospitalized before and being unable to continue working. It was always an up and down with his mood and state, never receiving a continuous therapy after leaving the hospital. Sadly it has gotten even more intense during the last months, leading him to retreat away completely now. Additionally, he vehemently opposes going back to the hospital. We used to hang out on discord for the past couple of years as me and his brother tried to integrate him into our discord groups (overlap with irl friends). As my friend was struggling with social relationships, he got along with our friends, but never truly connected with them independently. Additionally, his own group of friends were also growing apart, leading him to feel quite isolated. Now he send me a message, writing that he doesn't want to use discord any longer as he feels so awkward and distanced from me and my friends, not enjoying our online and irl interactions + he feels even worse through them. We are a friendly bunch, not using slurs, being pro LGBTQ+ and generally supportive of each other, yet most of my friends weren't perceived by him as his true friends. My partner, who also is part of the discord community was really struck by this, as she did feel that my friend was an actual friend to her. This just shows that his perspective does not represent the feelings of our friend group.

For my part, I was always quite overwhelmed with our relationship. I felt like I couldn't connect to his emotional side after we started growing apart. I always felt and still feel responsible for him and quite guilty for not reaching out that much, yet I did and still do not know how to approach this. We live in different cities now, making things a bit more difficult as he never really replies via text or call, rather texting or calling back only when he was ready to do so, which rarely happens. Him leaving Discord makes it harder to reach him and keep in touch. I am able to meet him in person at his place, but I don't want to intrude into his safe space. I feel like this might be the only way to reach him now and I am afraid of hurting him.

I genuinely want to see him happy and finding a way through life. I want him to feel better and I really would like to help him, but I don't know how.

I really would like you guys sharing your thoughts on this matter with me. What would you do in my situation and what would you like me to do if you were in my friends position.",friend struggling dont know hello redditors 25 wanted ask guys would deal situation would like treated friend 26 struggling depression years imo deeply linked every aspect life begin little background information used close since kindergarden grew gradually apart since primary school even though families still close would consider still closest always seemed family might spectrum struggled within social hierarchies pressures additionally really uninterested many topics yet talk hours special interests obviously say people spectrum share traits struggled school didnt similarly struggled finding new friends didnt sadly developed major depression last years hospitalized unable continue working always mood state never receiving continuous therapy leaving hospital sadly gotten even intense last months leading retreat away completely additionally vehemently opposes going back hospital used hang discord past couple years brother tried integrate discord groups overlap irl friends friend struggling social relationships got along friends never truly connected independently additionally group friends also growing apart leading feel quite isolated send message writing doesnt want use discord longer feels awkward distanced friends enjoying online irl interactions feels even worse friendly bunch using slurs pro lgbtq generally supportive yet friends werent perceived true friends partner also part discord community really struck feel friend actual friend shows perspective represent feelings friend group part always quite overwhelmed relationship felt like couldnt connect emotional side started growing apart always felt still feel responsible quite guilty reaching much yet still know approach live different cities making things bit difficult never really replies via text call rather texting calling back ready rarely happens leaving discord makes harder reach keep touch able meet person place dont want intrude safe space feel like might way reach afraid hurting genuinely want see happy finding way life want feel better really would like help dont know really would like guys sharing thoughts matter would situation would like friends position,2,0,0,Neutral,Low,[],[]

Hi, I don't really know where else to turn so I'm posting here. I've been on a waiting list to be admitted to therapy for 2 years, and the Ontario healthcare system is severely overloaded. Me and my mother live off my father's ODSP since he suffers from schizophrenia and contamination OCD, so private therapy is too expensive for us. I've been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and persistent depressive disorder, although I've been doing so poorly I'm not sure the latter is accurate to my situation anymore. I can't handle schoolwork, it's difficult to get myself to do anything but doomscroll, and even when I sit down to try and tackle it, it feels like I'm trying to levitate an elephant with my mind. I've gone from a gifted student to barely able to think. I switched to online school because, on top of my hardly coming in because I'm depressed, I was bullied pretty constantly, I think partly because of my visible queerness and partly because I have difficulties navigating a lot of social situations. For most of my life I hardly thought about what other people thought of me, but now I'm constantly insecure about my relationships, my appearance, and basically every facet of myself. I know that's kinda something that teenagers are known to do but it feels a lot more severe than just typical insecurity, I'm genuinely considering suicide. 

It feels like everything in me and around me are working against me. I hate myself, I can't handle any of my basic responsibilities, I can't learn or work in school, I'm decently sure my friends are gonna ditch me again, the news is constantly talking about how the country that I live like 5km away from is gonna take us over, my mom is suffering from a number of physical issues as a result of her arthritis and obesity, my father is really difficult to live with because if he misses his pills he becomes cruel and he's essentially drowning us in hand sanitizer, and I'm expected to plan for and work towards my future. I don't know what I can do to get any work done when I'm so behind and already so preoccupied with my own problems. Since I'm approaching Grade 11, the decisions I make now are beginning to have a more weight on my future. I'm not even sure if I can make it to the future, I'm starting to think this won't end in any way but killing myself. I know this all kinda looks like a tangled up rant or vent rather than a question, and this is only really scratching the surface of things, but my parents don't know how to help me anymore and I certainly don't know how to help myself.

Info before reading this: I am 18, diagnosed with depression and anxiety, living in Germany in an assisted living group home for the mentally ill. 

  
Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

# From Rock Bottom to Renewal: My Journey Out of Depression

I am going to be respectful of the rules of this community, so I will only share parts of my journey that align with its values.

Most of us who are deep in depression aren‚Äôt even on Reddit. I know this because I was there. When you're overwhelmed by depression, you don‚Äôt always recognize it as ""depression."" You don‚Äôt have the energy to get up, ask for help, or even consider a healing journey.

I was addicted to porn from a very young age‚Äîmy first exposure was at just seven years old. Depression followed me for most of my adult life. The best and worst thing that ever happened to me was losing everything. I lost 2.5 million Canadian dollars in the market, and after that, my sense of self didn‚Äôt even have money to keep itself alive.

I remember choosing the right bridge to jump off. But then, as if by some miracle, a van with a suicide hotline number printed on its side appeared outside my apartment. That moment changed everything. I called my dad and told him what had happened.

I get it‚Äîyou've probably heard all the advice, all the motivational talks. I had too. But when I hit rock bottom, I had only two choices: die or change.

I went back to my homeland for a few months, but I couldn't get along with anyone. I didn‚Äôt like anyone at all. After my shoulder surgery (which I needed because of multiple seizures that repeatedly dislocated it), I returned to Canada for physiotherapy.

Then I made a decision. I packed my bags and left for Nepal. I stayed there for eight months‚Äîsix of them in an ashram with a charlatan guru. After that, I spent a few more months in India. I learned a lot, but I still wasn‚Äôt healed.

Two books changed my perspective:

1. *The Alchemist*
2. *Man‚Äôs Search for Meaning*

Later, I traveled to Peru and learned from its indigenous people. By the end of my healing journey, I had become the person I never thought I could be‚Äîsomeone who now helps others overcome the same challenges I once faced.

Today, I live in Medell√≠n, Colombia. If someone asked me how I cured my depression, I would say:

1. Two great books
2. A heavy dose of disillusionment
3. Embracing my own humanity
4. The wisdom and support of my friends in the Amazon

Cheers. I hope you receive the same love and support that I did. You deserve it.

After almost 20 years of repeating the same patterns, I have finally stopped being in denial of the fact that I don‚Äôt think I can work anymore.

1jcwcyd,2025-03-16T22:33:28,"Need help with supporting spouse dealing with suicidal thoughts.
My SO has been dealing with many mental health issues her entire life, not least of which is depression and suicidal thoughts. Lately it's been getting a lot harder for her to deal with and is impacting our relationship a great deal. 

I've dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts in my past and stay vigilant about the warning signs, I haven't just ""gotten better"" and those things don't just go away, but they're easier to deal with now. My journey has involved a lot of hard self reflection and challenging internal struggles, but I think I'm in a better place. For her it's not the same and I'm really struggling with ways to help. 

This is a very complex issue so forgive me if this ends up oversimplified. Basically she isn't keen on therapy and doesn't want to take medication (though she is currently on an antidepressant). She struggles with self worth and other issues but consistently sabotage her own efforts to improve. When she seems on track to take a step forward she will suddenly give up or change direction. All the challenges of climbing out of the depression are there and all I can do is stand by and watch and I'm getting more and more concerned, especially as my own patience and frustration starts to bubble up and I have to withdraw so I don't end up making things worse. 

What can I do? Is there anything that can even be done? I think about my own struggles and how little anything that anyone said made a difference and I'm just racking my brain thinking of ways to be supportive.

Edit: A pretty important detail is that my SO tends to lash out quite a lot more than I ever did, making it harder to relate or understand what she's going through. It's also harder to be there to give support because when I offer support I'm harshly pushed away. Some insight into depression like that might be helpful for me, since my own experience was that I would simply close myself off but rarely actively push people away.

So me and my girlfriend are 18 now and we live in LA, and we've dated for over a year. She's suicidal and depressed right now, and I don't know what to do, this is my first love and first time experiencing this.

Here's some backstory.
About 12 years ago, her parents divorced due to her mother being abusive, and her father left to texas or somewhere around there. Her mother met this fat dude who isn't really fit to be a father. He always rants to mom about little things that my girlfriend did, and overall being a jackass. She has a brother and a sister but they are ignorant.

Her mother nowadays is still strict, and still gets mad at my girlfriend for not listening to her step dad. Because the step dad always rants to her about very small things and making it a big thing. This lead to depression for my girlfriend.

Another horrible thing that happened 5-7 years ago is that her step dad SA'd my girlfriend, but not full on r*pe. She has no evidence of this and she's become really suicidal about it. Even making threats to jump off a bridge. She can't tell her mother about it because her mother will think that she is ""crazy"" as her mother really also neglects her.

I really need help, I don't want her to double down on committing suicide. Please I need help.

I‚Äôm 17, and ever since I was diagnosed with social anxiety in 5th grade, it has completely dictated my life. It‚Äôs messed me up so much that I‚Äôve missed countless opportunities‚Äîthings like staying at a college of my choice for the summer or traveling to another country. It has even kept me from pursuing basic social milestones, like getting a job.

This has left me drowning in feelings of regret and resentment. I hate myself for repeatedly sabotaging the chances I‚Äôve been given. Whenever something promising comes my way, I end up screwing it up.

I‚Äôve tried so hard in school‚Äîtaking AP classes and trying to keep my grades decent‚Äîbut I don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm doing it. I‚Äôm not particularly talented at anything academically. I‚Äôm just doing all of this so I won‚Äôt be looked down on by my friends or others. I feel so lost. I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm working toward or why I‚Äôm trying at all.

It‚Äôs my 23rd birthday, and honestly, I just feel drained. I‚Äôm visiting my parents, and it feels like nothing changes. My dad always seems miserable, and my mom just sugarcoats their relationship. I can‚Äôt help but feel like I‚Äôm watching her stuck in this cycle of abuse‚Äîwe can never just enjoy family time without him throwing a fit over something small she‚Äôs said, or even just random things like the cold or a smell he doesn‚Äôt like.

It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm constantly walking on eggshells. I love my parents, but I‚Äôm scared for them to meet my boyfriend‚Äôs family, or anyone else for that matter. I‚Äôm scared to go out in public with them because I‚Äôm always worried my dad‚Äôs going to snap over something.

I‚Äôm also just really confused. I don‚Äôt understand how my mom can say she loves him when everything I see just looks so miserable. Sometimes I wonder if me being here is the problem‚Äîit makes me want to avoid coming over altogether.

Anyway, it just feels like another birthday and holiday down the drain. I always tell people I don‚Äôt care about these ‚Äúspecial‚Äù days, but the truth is, I do‚ÄîI think I‚Äôm just scared of being disappointed. I‚Äôm never asked what I want to do, and whenever I try to make plans with my parents, it just feels like a burden.

It‚Äôs hard not to reflect on the future. Things like my wedding, my parents meeting my in-laws, maybe even having kids one day and them experiencing all the same tension and anxiety I‚Äôve had growing up. And honestly, it makes me feel guilty, like I should be doing more for my mom, but I don‚Äôt know how to speak up for her. 

I also don‚Äôt know how to speak up for myself and how sad I am. I remember my dad telling me to stop crying as a kid when he‚Äôd yell, I think it‚Äôs because it made him feel bad. But ever since I just go silent, I am so scared of telling people how I am feeling, I start to shake and lose my ability to speak. 

I guess I am just rambling because I want to know if this will go away. I try so hard to live a regular life, but I don‚Äôt know how to anymore. I know I can‚Äôt control the relationships of others, abut I also don‚Äôt want to never be around my parents; yet it feels like I regress to being a teenager again every time I do.

Hello, I‚Äôm an 18 year old (F) and I‚Äôm just trying to figure out my life. My parents, whom I love with all my heart and soul, don‚Äôt love each other. They‚Äôre not divorced but ever since I was a kid I only see them arguing and that‚Äôs literally all they do. Somehow I always end up in the middle of it lol so it‚Äôs kind of annoying. I don‚Äôt want to sound corny or cringe but I never got support or advice on how to cope with that, so my brain literally just purposely forgets about it until I remember it again lol idk if it makes sense. But it affected my performance at school, and I know I shouldn‚Äôt let stuff like that affect me and let it stop me from doing what I‚Äôm supposed to, but it‚Äôs just so tiring seeing and knowing your parents hate each other. My dad comes and vents to me about mom, my mom comes and vents to me about him, it‚Äôs just so tiring. 

So they spent the last two nights arguing nonstop  and I overheard almost everything lol, they just argue about the same thing over and over again, and honestly I don‚Äôt blame my mom for feeling the way she feels because my dad isn‚Äôt the best husband or father. I heard him saying that he feels like we hate him so he‚Äôs distancing himself from us so that we can be happy. Which pissed me off by the way because the problem isn‚Äôt him being close to us, it‚Äôs him being far away from us because he works in another country and we see him every 2-3 months. And my mom is tired of that because all of the responsibilities is on her. I have 3 siblings btw and I‚Äôm the oldest, I‚Äôm trying my best to help. But obviously the house and the family  starts falling apart when the father isn‚Äôt present. The father is supposed to be what keeps us together and intact. A father is a leader and he‚Äôs not doing that. I worked with him for a couple of months and his job isn‚Äôt that demanding.

I'm also doing well in school. That's a great.

I‚Äôm relatively lean and think I look decent, but I never got more than a short fling when I was 21 (ironically when I looked much worse). No relationships. I‚Äôve been in college for a long time (now online) and have had to work full-time. The worst part is that I live in a small town in a southern state and can‚Äôt yet afford to move out from my grandmother‚Äôs house.

Thankfully, I‚Äôm making quick progress with my program and anticipate finishing this summer, so I‚Äôll be able to leave this dreadful region for a large northeastern city this fall. But I still feel so down. So many people my age have had great relationships, numerous vacations, and great jobs. And so many people on Reddit seem to live in advanced, liberal US cities. It‚Äôs unfair because it‚Äôs easier to afford to live in such cities if you start in them like all these people do. And my family always disregards my feelings about this area and what I want in life (no kids, to live in a large northeastern city).

1jmg0uo,2025-03-29T07:12:46,"Just a rant I guess
I‚Äôm a 20 year old female who struggles with borderline personality disorder. Struggling is an understatement, more so consumed by it every day. I‚Äôve been diagnosed for a couple of years now, there are days where I feel I ‚Äúcured‚Äù my disorder only for me to realize that‚Äôs another part of it. Every day I wake up and I feel I‚Äôm faking every interaction of my life, I‚Äôve faked for so long I don‚Äôt even know what my favorite color is. I feel so unbelievably empty. I‚Äôve agonized over this disorder since I was fourteen (before I was diagnosed or even knew what this disorder was). Around nine months ago I was broken up with (it was a long term relationship, we lived together, had a dog, etc) and it absolutely shattered me. I try to stay away from calling her my favorite person, it puts them on such a pedestal and it‚Äôs not fair. It‚Äôs a term I never classified her as because she was so much more, I truly loved her, enough so when I would have episodes I would try my best to never split on her, to go outside and run. She says this was the biggest reason she broke up with me, ‚ÄúI was emotionally unavailable‚Äù when in reality I just never wanted to hurt her. I know how ugly this disorder is, I know I‚Äôve burned bridges and hurt so many people. I never wanted that for her. The breakup was messy, she would mock me on the internet, I‚Äôd make fake numbers to harass her and cry, I said terrible things I never meant. Something I‚Äôll always regret because it was the biggest thing I held myself to with her, to never show her the ugly side of myself. Our last conversation ended two weeks ago with her saying, ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt the person I love‚Äù and it stung like a dagger because it is who I am, it‚Äôs who I‚Äôve always been, I just hid it from her for over two years. It ripped me apart knowing that she left me because I was emotionally unavailable but told me, ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt the person she loves‚Äù. She never loved me any side of me, couldn‚Äôt. It stung. I met her a couple months after a family member was arrested for SAing me since I was a kid (I never reported, he sold the videos/pictures of me and I got located by The missing and exploited children‚Äôs association). She was like a bandaid, I never got to recognize, recover, or work through my trauma associated with years of abuse. I was too focused on trying to be the perfect version of whoever I am for her. When she left, it all came crashing down, my PTSD got unbelievably intense, I have nightmares every night, I shake when I‚Äôm touched even by my mother. I still go to my room and look for her, for her comfort. After she left, I had no idea how to cope with the abuse I‚Äôve been in, the loss of her on top of it. I turned to addiction. Mainly alcohol, it‚Äôs consumed my life for the last nine months now but it‚Äôs getting to the point of when I finish the bottle my problems still exist in that moment. I am so worn, drained, and feel everything but nothing. I‚Äôm not sure what to do. I feel like a monster. I feel defeated.

It‚Äôs been slightly lonely at times but I‚Äôm usually a decently happy guy although I‚Äôve dealt with some level of depression most of my life. I work 5-6 days, and I have friends over a couple times a week.

Last week I was drinking with some friends at my place  and regrettably got the drunkest I‚Äôve ever been and ended up getting sick in my bathroom. The next day I had a really bad feeling of guilt and embarrassment and that night I started to feel like I was getting a cold

I ended up being sick for about a week. I went back to work even thought I wasn‚Äôt all the way better because I need the hours. I mentioned to my mom that I was starting to feel a bit lonely sometimes at my apartment, especially while being sick, so with my parents living close I went to stay the night with them. 

When I got there I took a hot shower and headed to bed although when I got to bed I noticed that my heartbeat wouldn‚Äôt slow down and I started having racing thoughts that weren‚Äôt even coherent. I would wake up every 30-40 minutes with an intense wave of anxiety and feel super nauseous and I would have to walk around or sit up for a minute it was really intense. That happened until about 9:00AM and then I was able to sleep for a few hours.

When I fully got up tho I had a really intense feeling of depression. And as I started to talk to my mom about it I just started bawling, and I usually don‚Äôt cry much. It‚Äôs the next day now, but ever since then I‚Äôve had the most intense sadness, depression, and anxiety I‚Äôve ever experienced happening all at once and I keep having the urge to cry. I also am having difficulty concentrating and find myself disassociating.

I have always felt guilty about being depressed. I am always careful when talking about my depression around other people. I mean, what do I have to be depressed about? 

I am not bragging when I say these things. I am conventionally beautiful. I am intelligent. I am witty. I am charming. I have no debt, except for my mortgage for a condo that only I am on the deed. I own my car. I travel a lot. I connect easily with things and people. People like me. I like who I am. In general, I am happy in my day-to-day life.

In my day-to-day life. I laugh every day. I am proud of myself every day. I go through each day knowing I am important, that I made a difference, that I did my best, that others like me, that I am proud of the things I did or said.

But I am depressed. I have depression. 

Today, I forced myself to cry, to release my emotions and feel better. In the middle of crying and yelling at myself, I actually, finally said ""It's not about the quality of life. It's the fact that I have to live at all.""

I never asked to be alive. I have always thought parents are selfish. They wanted to have kids so they did. But the child never consented to it. I have always realized this. But today, I actually said it out loud. 

It IS the fact that I have to live at all. The fact that I have a good life doesn't negate the fact that I don't want to be alive. It's not the quality of life. It's the living. I don't want to live.

I am not brave enough to kill myself. Like my best friend did over 10 years ago. But I can finally stop feeling guilty for being depressed. Because I am depressed not because of my circumstances, that I wish my life was better.

1jme6cd,2025-03-29T05:10:22,"Need help, currently wondering if i have depression and doubting/confused about if everything i ever felt troughout my life is real.
I don't ask for sympathy nor wanna seem like i'm a victim, i, like everyone else, did shit that i regret in the past and altough i don't feel pressured about it i still find myself feeling guilty for this and that.

I also don't wanna see people thinking i'm doing or writing this for attention, it's guaranteed that there are people going trough the same right now and i feel like saying things such as ""he just wants attention"" disregards not only my concerns but the experiences of others, please keep the comments respectfull.

If you have any questions or want more details about certain parts of my life story or my point of view please let me know, i left out big big parts not only due to my memory but because i'd be here all night writing and this already took me 1 hour and an half.

This can be considered a venting post since i don't have the courage to talk about this with any person i know, i'm scared of what they might think and i also want help from more experienced people on this in a  psychological and cientific manner.


Context about myself:

Hello, i'm a 19 year old man who is currenty dealing with confusion about his emotions, identity and wants to share his point of view.

I'm currently unemployed, i study music and thinking of going to college this year.

I prefer simplicity over complexity, while people may enjoy doing activities which are considered much more interactice i simply like walking aroundz talking abiut certain things and just resting in a bench or a park while talking and just seeing others enjoying the moment.

I always liked to help people and understand them before judging, i also like to talk a lot and i usually phrase what i want to say in big detail which i have been criticised for.

I like arts, hearing people talk about what they like, games, deep convos and reflecting on things that may not be spoken about so commonly.

I have difficulty iniciating a conversation and meeting new people altough i usually don't have any probles speaking with them if theynstart the conversation first.

My life story:

I've lost my innocence at a very young age, had an abusive father and a mother that had to work everyday to make me happy.

 Because of not getting the attention i needed as a child i ended up creating a dependance on fast food and games which made me obese at a very young age, this of course left me with an appearance that made it difficult to make friends which impacted how i act socially to this day, i got bullied and neglected by society to the point where even people that got involved would be called disgusting and would also be misstreated. I ended up making a friend, a black kid which i really liked, he treated me nicely even if people saw him as someone disgusting because of me, he ended up going to  a school in Angola, Africa after a year which made me say my first ever goodbye at 5 years of age.

Troughout my 4 years in primary school i managed to make 3 friends, 1 of them was a bit more distant ehile the other 2 had the same interests, i got to know these 2 specifically when the game Five Night's at Freddy's released and, altough i was happy when i was with them i always felt my life didn't ""have color"" to the point i literally started being unable to see color in things like the blue sky (which i perceived as a less-glowing blue) and most colors at the time felt ""greyish"" to me, not sure if there's something cientific related, if so please let me know as i would like to understand a bit more about myself.
The bullying continued as usual, kids would sometimes spit on me, i couldn't go to the cantheen or people would throw food at me so i started having lunch at home, got my front teeth broken and removed because of a kid who punched me, was minding my own business and got pushed from a very high place which traumatized me and now i can't be on high places with people behind me,  while everyone had their notebooks handed to them mine would be thrown at the desk in a way to avoid contact with both the notebook and me.

My grandpa (which was my father figure all my life) died when i was 7 which made me feel numbness, it also made me aggressive and i had to go to a psychologist.

Starting my 5th year it got even worse since my mother separated from my father, i didn't have any friends, people took advantage of me asking me for money falsely promissing to be friends with me only to ignore me each chance they had unless i had money to give them.
People from my class would constantly pinch me and make fun of my mom and wanted to switch schools.

6th grade was when i finally regained the ""color"" in my life and i finally made true friends that still are in my life today and are very important to me, they stick with me trough my lows but i don't have the courage to spill everything that goes on my mind cause i don't wanna be a bother to them even tho i am very talkative and get criticized for it a lot.

2020 was the best year in my life since i was able to lose weight and be happy with myself, i ran faster than ever and felt an adrenaline i didn't know was even possible, this i'm sure was the last time in my life i ever felt true honest happiness.

On 9th grade however i got into a severe depression which made me miss 6 months of school, get to 110kg and almost lose my friends, this impacted me completely and it's by far the worst year in my Life.

In highschool only one of my friends stayed in the same school as me and i still felt depressed altough i felt like i was getting better, i also had something that adults called ""sad eyes"" at the time, at that time my eyes were naturally dead so to say, i baaically had the face of someone who didn't care about life or anything in general, still i saw that people cared about me so i did an effort in order to change and to this day i forcefully create a normal look even tho i still have that face when i'm alone (i'm like that right now in case you're curious).

I made an effort and ended up losing 30 pounds which landed me on 80KG, i later got to 70 which is the ""normal"" weight for my height.

I finished Highschool, graduated now i'm here.


What i realised about mu life and how i feel nowadays:

What i came here to talk about mainly is how i feel like, after reaching adulthood, i realised that i had depression for my entire life and not just after 9th grade.

I have everything to be happy, good friends, a mom that cares and supports me in everything she can, an appartment that i will inherit, i'm good at music and have a thing called ""perfect pitch"" which is almost a cheat code, i don't suffer from any finantial problems and have everything i always want even if it takes time.

Altough it might sound bad, i hate myself and i simply can't live with myself, i see what i am and it feels me with disgust and sadness seeing how if someone else was chosen they would be way better than me at just living life and just enjoying the life i have to the fullest.
I constantly think of being killed as i honestly don't have the courage to kill myself, i don't know if any of the emotions i ever felt besides sadness and numbness were even real, i'm currently having difficulties feeling and even smiling at my friends, when i laugh i'm always conscious and it feels like i'm just faking it even tho i'm not.

I'm just having trouble understanding if what i feel is even true at this point, if i can even feel emotions with 100% honesty and not only it makes my head hurt it keeps me awake at night, i'm just a 19 year old guy, i don't know what i'm doing and even if i'm emotionally stable and this is normal since everyone deals with their own shit and most of them doesn't like to tell, also, i find it easier to live life when i erase emotions completely since i stop feeling fear.

Just came here to talk about this cause i'm starting to recover some memories, good and bad, and i also want to know if it's worth it seeing a therapist or this is just stupidity of me or i am being childish.

If you read this, sorry for taking your time and thanks for your attention.

If you are going trough ghe same experience as me feel free to share since i have lots of time and do nothing with it.

This is gonna probably seem bratty but it‚Äôs bothering me. In September I had to have emergency surgery to remove an ectopic pregnancy in my left fallopian tube. We had planned a vacation to Panama City beach, FL.  2 days later we left for the beach‚Ä¶ I was tired and sore, but I was excited as the pregnancy news came as a surprise(I only found out 5hrs before surgery and was bleeding internally) and I didn‚Äôt have time to process anything. While we were there I got excited and thought of the idea to go to Disney World (happiest place on earth, right?) I looked it up and it was gonna be about $600 to go for a day and get a room to stay in. It was a 6hr drive there and honestly, just wanted to eat a Mickey bar in front of the castle wearing some ears and maybe ride the small world ride. That is literally all I wanted out of that. It was a little thing that I thought would make me happy. I talked it over with my husband and I wanted to go so bad but I didn‚Äôt want to spend all that money for a day and he didn‚Äôt want to drive the 6hrs. He reminded me we said we would go in February for a week and it was okay to not go for a day just after surgery. Fast forward to now‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt have the money to go anymore and I didn‚Äôt get that day‚Ä¶ I keep trying to tell myself it‚Äôs stupid and it‚Äôs expensive but in reality I was really excited and kinda heartbroken over it. It was the part I wanted out of the trip and we had originally planned to go to both but changed at last minute and we‚Äôre gonna go in February for a week instead . I hate sand but love the sound of the ocean and I had fun but I was exhausted. I was sore and walking through the sand was annoying and hard. I‚Äôm not mad we can‚Äôt go I‚Äôm just upset over it. My family (husband and daughter) enjoy the beach. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I had fun and I‚Äôm thankful for the time but I just feel kinda robbed‚Ä¶ that was a lot all at once to process and I didn‚Äôt get that day and now I don‚Äôt get to go at all. He said we could go next year but I‚Äôm not holding my breath for it because it is just getting more and more expensive. I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ I feel like a brat because many don‚Äôt get to even do that..I just am sad over it. I also have had another surgery since then to remove my other fallopian tube and I‚Äôve been kinda a wreck. It was never that I didn‚Äôt want more kids‚Ä¶it was that pregnancy was hard and my mental health got worse after my daughter and I was diagnosed as bipolar with depression and anxiety. I think I mostly did it so that would never happen again. I was terrified of getting pregnant again and it happened and I couldn‚Äôt process it or even make the decision for myself what we would do‚Ä¶ it was all decided for me in a matter of hours.

Unsure where to post this so I‚Äôll just drop this here, first time poster so unsure on how this all works.

I often feel estranged from everyone and everything. I have problems expressing my emotions to the point where I keep them to myself for so long to where I actually forget them. I wake up not really remembering why I was upset and then the day after don‚Äôt feel upset at all. I‚Äôm awkward around everyone. Not to a noticeable point but I‚Äôm definitely awkward. Unsure when to end conversations, unsure when to start it, and have trouble knowing where to look. I often bump into people or do that weird thing where I you shuffle to the left and right with people until one of you finally breaks it. It‚Äôs annoying, embarrassing, and awkward. It happens almost every single time I encounter another human, at work, school, or even at home. I‚Äôm so awkward to the point where I often feel like I may have some type of mental illness or disability because I find myself to be so different then other people and find basic things like walking to be hard. I forget, easily. I forget to do simple things at work and end up shuffling around like ‚Äúwhat did I come here to do again?‚Äù Or ‚Äúwhat should I do next?‚Äù. I‚Äôm only not akward with one person and that‚Äôs my girlfriend but even with her I still act weird. I have trouble expressing my emotions and am unsure if what I‚Äôm feeling is valid (the reason I am writing this). My mental health has never really been steady since around the pandemic, or atleast was when I really started to notice it. I‚Äôve made a couple of half hearted attempts to take my life before like get so drunk to the point where I could have the guts to stab myself and go all the way through with it. I‚Äôve in a way made other micro attempts? Or not even sure maybe idealation of taking my life. Like driving fast when I don‚Äôt feel good hoping maybe someone will hit me and I‚Äôll end up in the hospital or maybe just die. I‚Äôm not sure tho when I think of it in a normal state of mind dying is scary. But when I don‚Äôt feel good it‚Äôs like I spiral and think of extremes. I feel like I don‚Äôt even know myself at times. When I think of life without my girlfriend I think of one without purpose. If I were to move without her would I have the drive to live? Or would I deem it too much and take my life. Even writing this I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt and that this is a weird thing to do but I want change. I don‚Äôt want to feel like this. I don‚Äôt want to feel like this hollow person who has no personality and no drive. I don‚Äôt want to hide my mental state to my loved ones and especially my girlfriend. I want to stop lying and say with 100% honesty that I love being me and being alive.

1jmcslm,2025-03-29T03:51:44,"The depression of sheltered girl realizing their parents actually suck
I(20f) and every time I speak to my mom I feel be more depressed. I hate to say it, but I don‚Äôt think I can have a close relationship with my mom anymore and I‚Äôm dreading going back home this summer. 

Every child comes to realize their parents arent all they thought they were‚Äîand I reallu believed I had gotten to that point‚Äîbut each time I pull another layer back and realize just how little people I have in my corner and I feel so trapped. I was so sheltered; I wasn‚Äôt allowed to get a job, a boyfriend, sleepovers, or anything that would distraught me from my academics, so I lack social cues and assumed I would always have the stability. I‚Äôve always been so glad for my family, especially my mother and sister, and oftentimes they were the only saving grace while struggling with genetic depression. 

Now I‚Äôm going to be 21 soon and debating taking on an internship with my school just so I can have an excuse to not come home over the summer and face her.

She even refused to take me to my grandparents because I just wasn‚Äôt in the place for such an ordeal. 

When I finally got back to campus I was able rebuild my mental health, focus on school, and just really focus on improving my mental state and health.

I'm not officially diagnosed with anything except anxiety, but I also haven't went to get diagnosed with anything either. About 2 months ago, I finally decided that I needed to get things together and push myself to do something about my mental health. I don't really have anyone in my life to go to, so I am just doing this all alone, but so far I feel like I've been taking the right steps here on getting better. 

So my issue here is that when I'm around friends or family, I feel fine and happy. Maybe once out of the blue do I get really upset around them, but my problem is that whenever I don't have any plans with anyone and am left alone, I just feel that sense of dread come back. I know that It's irrational, but my brain makes me overthink and believe that all my friends don't actually want to be around me and are pretending. I feel like all the progress I've made with getting better just disappears in an instant.

TW: suicide, SH

My heart is racing as I type this, because I've never explicitly told anyone that I was suicidal.

I have struggled on and off with c\*tt\*ng. Nobody knew. Nobody knows how it consumes my thoughts nearly all the time.

I am no longer at the lowest point anymore, and haven't been for some time, but I never stopped fantasizing about ending it. I am terrified of the thought of being treated differently- and yet at the same time, I needed someone to notice. I need to be treated accordingly by the people around me. I don't even know what that means, I don't even know if it makes sense. I was deeply suicidal, I still think about it constantly. I can't have anyone think I am weak, but damn do I want them know.

1jmayr7,2025-03-29T02:14:53,"I‚Äôve given up
Hi. My name is Malin, im a female and I‚Äôm from Norway and I‚Äôm 21 years old. My mental health history is quite unique and complex- and not in a good way. 

I‚Äôm here to sort of vent, but don‚Äôt know how to do it properly. 

I never had a good life, and I never sort of knew how to connect with others, school, and just living in general I always have felt so lost and sad. And not just that I drag myself down on purpose since i have so many negative thoughts in my head like: your never going to be good enough again, you‚Äôre never going to fit in, you‚Äôre a failure, my body isn‚Äôt thin enough, I‚Äôm so stupid, you‚Äôre never gonna accomplish things in life, you‚Äôre always going to end up in and out of hospitals and wards, you will never get a girlfriend who will accept you, nor friends people will never accept what I‚Äôm saying and just misunderstand me. And you know what? My mind was right. I feel like a total failure. And I accomplished nothing. I feel dead and lost. 

First of all I‚Äôm born with cerebral palsy and it affects my mental and fysically health, that has really made me the most depressed. 

Everything worsened trough the years, when I was in elementary school I got bullied from 2nd to 7th grade by my class but mostly one boy there. Psychologically‚Ä¶ for 6 years‚Ä¶ and also had tremendous anxiety and social anxiety I also struggled with nonverbal learning disorder I was diagnosed with it and I didn‚Äôt know until three years ago. My communication broke down and I couldn‚Äôt concentrate properly since I had difficulties with that emensely. In high school I got ignored or laughed at. For 2 years until I said I quit. In the end of elementary school I begin to question myself and my self image and all that and I developed the eating disorder anorexia‚Ä¶ in 2016, my first thought was I‚Äôm finally going to gain control of something, since I never felt in control or never in the driving seat. But finally I was able to control something. I was near death, but still didn‚Äôt want to let go. I‚Äôm finally going to accomplish my dream body. And no one is going to stop me. I was in there two months till I finally was stabilized. But I didn‚Äôt get better I kept going, in and out of therapy without luck. In and out of therapy I was inpatient again this time in a long stable clinic focusing on my eating disorder and my anxieties, but I refused to let go of my addiction and control. I tried many times but I couldn‚Äôt get rid of the thought of just having control. I experienced being locked in a room for one hour, just because I was crying, and I also experienced some sort of violence they dragged me to the kitchen and almost ripped my sweater off and they psychologically abused me, are you going to drink all that? Or eat all that my mentality began getting worse. Until my parents decided that this place was no good. Then late 2017, I developed extreme OCD. I had to had control over my personal things, and write stuff down whatever it took. I also if I lost something I would go wild, because I felt I had no control. So I started crying and had deep panic attacks without any stopping till I had control again. I began to run away from home because I was in pain and in deep loneliness and desperately needed control back. I was taken back home, drawing stuff on the walls and thought the wall was mine and stuff even though we rented the apartment at the time. I also glued myself because of some earrings I wanted and I lost them, and I couldn‚Äôt wait for them so I made them and glued them to my ears. I was so extreme I didn‚Äôt even wash my clothes because I thought they would be gone in the bathroom. In late 2017 , I went inpatient again three times the periods of 2017-2018-2019, it was a unit for eating disorders. I was completely shattered and I refused to eat or cooperate. But I wanted to get out of there but couldn‚Äôt, I tried to tell the doctors that it‚Äôs hard to let go, and they seemed to understand that. One day in the unit I refused to listen to anyone I set with a pair of headphones on and sat on the floor, till I WAS DRAGGED ON THE FLOOR LAYING DOWN SCREAMING. Because I wanted them to let go. I was locked in a room for one hour without any proper explanation. I tried my hardest to cooperate but I just couldn‚Äôt. But one day, I changed my mind for just wanted to get out of the unit. I ate and cooperated to just get out as fast as possible. When I was home again I started with my same old habits. It got so bad months later in 2018, I was inpatient again‚Ä¶ in the same unit. I hated it there, I got no support, no understanding or nothing. So again I refused to cooperate completely. It resulted in a feeding tube for 10 days straight‚Ä¶ since I didn‚Äôt cooperated I was there one month only and didn‚Äôt understand my needs properly. Because later next year, I was tired out. In 2019, I tried to cooperate but they wanted absolutely everything to be on their terms. I couldn‚Äôt get anything to make food simpler. And I tried to convince them of it, but no. They also had made a tremendous mistake not including me in my own treatment plan. So it resulted in that i listened to them without any luck of getting better because I was done. It didn‚Äôt work anyways there. I still have the same issues to this day and you guys will know eventually why. In 2020, I started OCD therapy it lasted a couple months it was just some stupid tests like take away things from me, and try to eat. It didn‚Äôt help much so I quitted, I also try to say what I wanted from them without any luck. The problem was NO ONE WAS LISTENING TO ME OG WHAT I HAD TO SAY. It drove me crazy so in late 2021 I was inpatient again with a constant feeding tube sticking to my skin, this time with staff slowly convincing me to accept help, I did my best but still was thrown out even though I came with some helpful advice to probably help me. Then, in late 2021, I began to show symptoms of depression I stopped caring eventually about myself and the world because no one was listening to me no matter what and I still had the desire to gain control of my perfect thin body or to control things because of my OCD. The depression stuck in and in eventually late 2022 I began to just stay in my room. I also had a cognitive test early 2022, because of my depression and CP. I was diagnosed with nonverbal warning disorder and possible mild/moderate retardation. And cognitive decline. That was hard to take in, so I got even more depressed. I slowly in late 2023, stopped thinking clear and simply went in rest mode, not sleeping, not changing clothes and staying in my room. I came to a psych ward about three times in 2023, because if I began to take overdoses of different medications, and since it has continued I just began slowly to decline myself. And didn‚Äôt give a fuck, because no one was giving me the proper treatment. In late 2024, the same was happening inpatient because of serious medical overdoses, and I was in and out of wards. Until late 2024, I got accepted into a treatment center via the local hospital. I was in and out of it three times because i was finally beginning to accept help (since 2021) but my therapists wouldn‚Äôt LISTEN. I also began to self harm then, in 2024. So I was discussing with them back and forth for 6 fucking months. Until there was a meeting with the leader who said if I complained anymore about the treatment i would get thrown out. And I thought this is it I‚Äôm going to give up totally I tried everything to get understood, but without any luck. I got also diagnosed with mixed developmental disorders. And serious trauma symptoms and overload. After that my body was completely burnt out. And I thought to myself I don‚Äôt give a fuck about anything anymore including myself if I die I die. In 2025, I finally got more understood from all instances, and are now getting muncipal treatment for a long period, a staffed house, and more. But I still have my doubts if anything will change. I always go back but should I try should I not? I still have a constant fight, I also lost all contact with my inner family. Things are still not better today, and I totally lost all hope and have completely given up. My day consists of sleeping, being on my phone distracting myself or self harming or not taking care of myself at all and don‚Äôt give a fuck about anything, that‚Äôs it really, I‚Äôm burnt out. I will try out that rehabilitation center. I will try my best, but I still have given up. I also have no social circle. So that‚Äôs my story. 


More details: 

(In detail: in 2016, I lost my breath on several occasions of serious trauma. Also developed anorexia 

In 2017, I was psychologically abused and paralyzed by the staff and I was also experiencing violence they pushed me and dragged me down the hall so hard I got bruised. Developed extreme OCD also.

In 2017 no one listened to my needs and they I needed time in the unit I was also pushed to the brink with purpose by the staff, and they dragged me down the hall with force because I just couldn‚Äôt sit down. 

In 2018, I was severely malnourished and tried to give the same unit another chance but I was pushed down and treated like garbage and had a feeding tube thrown in my nose (basically troat 10 days straight) 

In 2019 I ha lost all confidence of getting better, and the same happened they got behind my back made a treatment plan and if I sent follow one of the terms I got the throwned out. 

In 2020, I got ocd therapy i got belittled like a child with stupid stuff thrown in my face for practice to condemn myself of not get panicked by the feeling that some stuffed was gone, even though it wasn‚Äôt mine, stupid‚Ä¶

In 2021 I got major depression  and started loosing control over myself and just stayed in my room. I was inpatient again for my eating disorder and this time with violence I was dragged down standing up till I hit my 
head hard on a metal bed. I was also restrained in bed by my arms so they got bruises. I also lost contact with my sister. 

In 2022, I started to further decline with my depression and started to not change clothes not go so much outside I was also diagnosed in a cognitive test with nonverbal learning disorder. And cognitive decline. 

In 2023, I began to take overdoses with different kinds of medication, I want to the ward two-three times for severe overdose. 
I also began extreme self harming. And was also inpatient multiple times in a ward.


In early 2024, my depression further declined in 2024, till I no longer started to give a fuck about anything including myself if I die I die. I got also diagnosed with serious trauma symptoms and overload. Including mixed developmental disorders. 
I was in that help clinic also when the leader started to threaten me with if I complain more I get throwned out. 
It had gotten so bad my situation, I didn‚Äôt take care of my hygiene, my sleep, my food intake, self harming regularly, and not taking medications regularly so this had resulted in municipality treatment.  I was also being treated like shit earlier in 2024 in the ward where I was laughed at, lied too, experienced violence and was not heard because of my needs this has happened for almost a decade now, and told I should stay in the street by staff‚Ä¶ this had happened on multiple occasions. 

So all this has resulted in me struggling with my CP, for not getting heard over that, struggling fysically and mentally. And it has worsened, Struggling with my social skills and general social anxiety, and just anxiety. Severe depression maybe chronically‚Ä¶ 4 years now struggling with depression. Severe self harming and suicidal, not taking care of myself, severe eating disorder anorexia, severe ocd, and trauma and overload means I‚Äôm totally burnt out. 


To summarize: I still have a constant battle inside me, should I get better or not? Nothing has helped before, and I‚Äôm continuing to struggle and no one is listening, but it‚Äôs better now, but I still have completely given up. Lost all interests, feel no happiness, I feel empty and dead. But deep deep inside I want to have it better. I also have extreme paranoia and as resulted I‚Äôm scared of having a normal life be sure of all this including aging to feel like I wasted my life‚Ä¶ 

Thank you for listening. I‚Äôm a loser and always will be‚Ä¶

More details: 
After all this I have diagnoses: 
General anxiety disorder 
Anorexia 
Compulsive disorder and behavior 
Severe trauma symptoms and overload 
Mixed developmental disorders 
Cognitive decline 
Nonverbal learning disorder 
Most likely mild/moderate retardation 
Severe cp with spasms, and uncontrollable motions in my body including severe pain if I stand too long on my feet.  
I also suspect other symptoms and diagnoses. 
But that will be done in a new test when I will get inpatient to a rehabilitation center.)

I don't know if anyone really cares, but I'm feeling worthless.

I've been trying at this adulthood thing for over a decade and I just can't seem to do it.

Like I tried my best to be a productive citizen and a mature adult.

I tried to join the military to pay for school, I wasn't good in the military but I was able to get in my 4 years.

I tried a job at a security guard just to pay the bills while I spent years trying to figure myself out. Believe or not even a simple job like that I made some mistakes and it wasn't great pay but enough to get by.

But yeah I kept going through the motions, trying to figure my life out, I thought I finally figured my life out by going to trade school. I wasn't the best, but I managed to do okay for myself

and I felt I was finally gonna make something off myself and finally stop being a kid and be an adult for once.

but the following year, after graduation I got my first new job as a maintenance technician for Circle k. Not a great start to my career, but a start. 

Problem is, my landlord decided to kick my out of my apartment so I had to move in with family.

I was overworked, overwhelmed, stressed, and frustrated working my new job and I kept making mistakes on trying to fix things and filing my paperwork wrong. 

And after a year of this job they fired me this mourning and I've never felt lower.

Like I don't know what to do, I've been trying to improve myself for years, I've been trying to make something for myself. Try to actually be an adult and my life keeps getting worse.

Like I almost feel like I never should have left my security job. Like sure it wasn't a lot of pay, but fuck it was at least doable and I feel life just wants fucking punish me for trying to do something. 

Like fuck you for ever trying.

I've just never felt so frustrated with myself.

Cause for the past couple years my life has been going backwards 

and the worst part, I don't know if will stop going backwards. I'm genuinely scared it'll get worse from here. 

I don't know what to do, I've never felt so low in my life",yeah got fired first time im feeling really low right dont know anyone really cares im feeling worthless ive trying adulthood thing decade cant seem like tried best productive citizen mature adult tried join military pay school wasnt good military able get 4 years tried job security guard pay bills spent years trying figure believe even simple job like made mistakes wasnt great pay enough get yeah kept going motions trying figure life thought finally figured life going trade school wasnt best managed okay felt finally gonna make something finally stop kid adult following year graduation got first new job maintenance technician circle k great start career start problem landlord decided kick apartment move family overworked overwhelmed stressed frustrated working new job kept making mistakes trying fix things filing paperwork wrong year job fired mourning ive never felt lower like dont know ive trying improve years ive trying make something try actually adult life keeps getting worse like almost feel like never left security job like sure wasnt lot pay fuck least doable feel life wants fucking punish trying something like fuck ever trying ive never felt frustrated cause past couple years life going backwards worst part dont know stop going backwards im genuinely scared itll get worse dont know ive never felt low life,10,1,0,Neutral,Low,[],[]

I often feel resentful towards my family. I struggle to let go of past traumas and grudges from my school/college days, and it bothers me that those I once disliked seem to be doing well while I am not.

I want to write so much, share so much but I don't know if I have the strength or stamina to do that but I will try to make some sense !

Right now I am at a stage in life where I feel so isolated and alone. I have lost all my patience, I have no hope in life, I just don't want to deal with anything. I have a beautiful daughter who is only 15 months old and she is my only reason to keep on living at the moment but sometimes I feel so low and depressed that I just pray to God to end my life. I do have suicidal thoughts sometimes , actually most of the times but I am just trying to hang in there. 

I am no saint, I know I have done a lot of sins in my life and I am sure that I still continue to do shit in life , that is another guilt that I have with Me. I feel like God is not pleased with me and may be I will remain unhappy my whole life as a punishment.

Being an introvert, I have always bottled up my feelings inside of me, I don't know if anyone understands me. Even my husband who I thought is my best friend is maybe tired of me, he is not the man I thought he was. He is not there for me emotionally like I expected him to be. I feel like our marriage will crumble soon. Although he is all I have and he is not a bad person but he makes me feel lonely, worthless and vulnerable.

Anyways my husband is not the sole reason for my depression although he may have intentionally or unintentionally contributed to it, there are multiple other reasons. Even that is not the point, the point is I am LOST and alone and I don't want to live anymore.

1jm9ean,2025-03-29T00:56:35,"Is it selfish to give up?
I have been lying in my bed with my suicidal thoughts for almost a month now (although my depression became out of control a year ago). I only leave my place to go to work, the rest of the time I just watch YouTube and order food that I eat in my bed. Long story short, I gave up. I gave up on my dreams, my projects, my friends, even my family. My mother keeps trying to contact me to have some news but I do not care enough anymore to answer. Even if I did I would not have nothing positive to say to her as there is not much in my life than my bed and my job (just to pay the rent and the food to be clear).

Here comes the reason of my post. I have just watched a documentary about the show Peaky Blinders and there is a part that talks about Helen McCrory who played Polly in the show (she also played Narcissa Malfoy in the Harry Potter saga). I quite like that actress, unfortunately she passed away due to cancer but even when sick, she kept working on the show. Even fighting against death she kept giving life to a character, and she gave an amazing performance in my opinion. 

History is full of person who did great things even when they were about to die. Here is another exemple: if you listen to ""Show must go on"" by Queen, know that Freddy Mercury was already sick because of aids while recording the song, his last song ever recorded, and he sang one of the most phenomenal rock song ever, still in my opinion.

So here is why I am wondering tonight: there are people all around the world fighting even when doomed, keeping doing what we expect them to do, keeping loving and being there for they loved ones, not giving up even if they know that it is the end for them. And me, I just let myself rotting in my bed because I just think I am not good enough, not doing anything about my depression nor with my life.

Is it selfish to give up and wait to die without doing anything of my life when thousands of people outside never give up?

Note: the only depression I am talking about is mine, I do not blame anyone who is suffering from depression and/or suicidal tendencies. I am just wondering if I, and only I, have the right to give up. I am open to discussion.",selfish give lying bed suicidal thoughts almost month although depression became control year ago leave place go work rest time watch youtube order food eat bed long story short gave gave dreams projects friends even family mother keeps trying contact news care enough anymore answer even would nothing positive say much life bed job pay rent food clear comes reason post watched documentary show peaky blinders part talks helen mccrory played polly show also played narcissa malfoy harry potter saga quite like actress unfortunately passed away due cancer even sick kept working show even fighting death kept giving life character gave amazing performance opinion history full person great things even die another exemple listen show must go queen know freddy mercury already sick aids recording song last song ever recorded sang one phenomenal rock song ever still opinion wondering tonight people around world fighting even doomed keeping expect keeping loving loved ones giving even know end let rotting bed think good enough anything depression life selfish give wait die without anything life thousands people outside never give note depression talking mine blame anyone suffering depression andor suicidal tendencies wondering right give open discussion,1,0,0,Neutral,High,[],[]

1jm8xxu,2025-03-29T00:34:52,"Getting things off my chest
hey everyone, i just want to vent and get things off my chest because i do not have anyone to talk to i don't know how to start. my first memories as a child are of my mother chasing me with belt in her hand and then catching me and beating me with metal part of it, that and also my mom fighting with my dad and calling him worthless and incapable. my relatives calling her a whore and beating my mom. these are my first memories. my mom always had conflict with my dad and his family and they hated her too, she often said that she would not have remained there if it was not for me, and she often blamed me for her unhappiness and told me she wished i was not born. in these fights sometimes she would pass out, i always thought she was dying. i remember when one time she passed out when i was with her alone, i did not know what to do so i went up to her and kept shaking her screaming mom. once i started going to school my mom decided to move to a different city and she took me with her, my dad did not even object, he never really cared about me, even these days when i try to connect with him he just dismisses me. well the suffering did not end with splitting up of my parents, mom was still a ruin, she would often take out her frustrations on me, almost everyday she berated me and insulted me and sometimes beat me with different things like belt and once almost crushed my knee with a hammer, this really affected me. at that time i thought that i was the bad kid, when she beat me i would beg god for forgiveness and help, after she beat me i would go up to her and keep saying that i would be a good boy and i would believe and do everything she asked for, i remember few times she grabbed me got on me and started choking me with both of her hands, and she would keep telling me to shut up. one night she was so angry that she grabbed a knife and chased me across room, she kept asking if i wanted to die, and that it would make everyone happy. this was around a time when i started school, because of these stuff i was kind of weird but i tried my best. however at some point when i was 13 or 14 i started getting bullied in school, i got beat often, and insulted, until i started beating them back. around 14 or 15 i remember when i and my mom were fighting and she started to attack me and i punched her, that made her back off, but i realized that day that if i wanted to make my life better i had to do something hard, however it didn't change my life, i simply made more enemies, then in highschool my mom decided to move back to my hometown because i had lots of problems and  was failing in school, and also everyone, including the teachers hated me and tried to blame me for everything, i moved back in my hometown and it was small and i only had like 6 or 7 classmates, you would think my life changed, but at that point i was too damaged, i had seen and felt too much, and also the pandemic hit around that time and i was left basically isolated for around 1 or 2 years, after that i went to university finally got away from my family, got into law and started living on my own. at first i had hope that everything was starting to look better, but the truth is some wounds never heal, because of these i couldn't get friends or i could not find SO and so on so basically i turned into loner. after all these, i started to actively try to change my life for better did all the self improvement stuff and actually somewhat turned into normal person if you do not consider complete lack of social skills, inexperience and anxiety, but i pushed through. and i realized that it does not matter how much you do or change at some point you are gone and can not find your place, i do not enjoy anything that is related to people, and just today i realized how much i am damaged, i was on a date with cutest girl i have ever seen, which i somehow managed to pull, and i completely fucked it up. and i just realized that right now i am completely alone in a different country with no one checking in on me, and all the liars and asshole people, i am turning 21 in almost 2 months and i am still kissless virgin but that is least of my problems right now. how did i end

I'm 23 years old. I don't have a degree or a steady job, but I have enough savings to go somewhere far away for three or four years without doing anything. I need some advice before I do something stupid.

Hello, 17 live in Va and have been going through a very rough two months. I quit high school two years ago because I have crippling social anxiety and have been carrying instant gratifying habits for a while now. I recently started talking to a girl and I‚Äôve learned I‚Äôm more of an overthinker than I was aware of. I get obsessed way too fast, and then unbeknownst to them I give them full access to my thoughts and feelings having them live in my head rent free. Things were going well for a month, and then It just died out and received mixed signals, for a time it was the happiest I‚Äôd been in my life. So now Ive turned into an avoidant out of self preservation and now I feel like an asshole for taking hours to reply to them, always have been to a certain extent with my peers but wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be this way with this person. The limerance is real‚Ä¶ So I get in these states of just utter sadness and hopelessness and I start having suicidal thoughts basically thinking I‚Äôm not good enough and have no motivation to do anything. I think I‚Äôve been cursed, maybe I did this to myself, Idk maybe I‚Äôm autistic but I do know my self esteem has been low since middle school and never feel comfortable in my own skin unless I‚Äôm in a solitary environment or on a walk at 3:00 am at night. I have no desire to socialize with people and am not ready for a relationship let alone friendships because I don‚Äôt love myself, I‚Äôm emotionally mature and a good person never put others down and am very nice to everyone I meet but feel like that just hurts me more in the end when I give people my all. When I get in these states I just can‚Äôt self regulate, I sit in the sadness and just don‚Äôt want to feel this pain in my heart. I have people to talk to but it doesn‚Äôt help, it‚Äôs not going to change my thought process. So I don‚Äôt know why I came on here to vent, this is the equivalent of writing smth in notes app since it‚Äôs really just a long paragraph of self pity and not at all open ended. I don‚Äôt know maybe other people can relate I‚Äôm sorry not trying to make myself a burden for anyone I‚Äôm my own responsibility but tips on how to get better and stop caring would be helpful I hear meditating is good, finding hobbies, and how do I get the motivation to do these things.",im sad hello 17 live va going rough two months quit high school two years ago crippling social anxiety carrying instant gratifying habits recently started talking girl ive learned im overthinker aware get obsessed way fast unbeknownst give full access thoughts feelings live head rent free things going well month died received mixed signals time happiest id life ive turned avoidant self preservation feel like asshole taking hours reply always certain extent peers wasnt expecting way person limerance real get states utter sadness hopelessness start suicidal thoughts basically thinking im good enough motivation anything think ive cursed maybe idk maybe im autistic know self esteem low since middle school never feel comfortable skin unless im solitary environment walk 300 night desire socialize people ready relationship let alone friendships dont love im emotionally mature good person never put others nice everyone meet feel like hurts end give people get states cant self regulate sit sadness dont want feel pain heart people talk doesnt help going change thought process dont know came vent equivalent writing smth notes app since really long paragraph self pity open ended dont know maybe people relate im sorry trying make burden anyone im responsibility tips get better stop caring would helpful hear meditating good finding hobbies get motivation things,1,0,0,Positive,Low,[],[]

I‚Äôm not sure how to begin, but I have questions and could use some honest counsel and answers from others.

Lately, I‚Äôve been wondering about suicidal thoughts, even though I‚Äôm currently on a journey to improve my health. 
Reflecting on some of the darkest times in my life, I realized that one of the main reasons I didn‚Äôt follow through was my family. 
I didn‚Äôt care about myself as much, but I couldn‚Äôt bear the thought of hurting my parents, my siblings. 
How long would they carry that pain?

Another reason was my religious beliefs, which kept me grounded when things felt unbearable.

Thus, I‚Äôm curious what keeps others who are struggling from going through with it? Are these thoughts normal; 
Will I my darkness consume me one day; and 
is the way I‚Äôve been dealing with them healthy? Now when I get these fleeting suicidal thought I try to push them to the back of my mind and focus on resolving personal issues until my next therapy session.

I want to preface this by saying I know and I accept that I was wrong and now I'm just so full of regret. I can't call him my boyfriend because I was always so hesitant and could never fully commit. To be fair growing up my immigrant parents always made me feel like I owed them my life. They always say they gave their everything for me and in a way they always made it seem like I had to do the same for them. Up until recently I was fully convinced that I would never be happy and I wouldn't be able to start my life until I was forty and my family was set. Feeling this burden and commitment to them always made me unsure of having my own commitments in life especially regarding having a significant other. I can't commit to someone if I have to take care of my family. Him (22) and I(23) have been best friends for the last six years. The connection was unreal and like nothing I've ever had, even he agreed. For the last three years we've acted like a couple but he's put in so much effort into me and always wanted nothing more than to be with me. I would always shoot him down and even encouraged him to see other people because I figured if I saw him with someone else I could move on and stay focused on living my life for my family. I caused a lot of damage and I regret it deeply. I recently had an epiphany and realize that I loved this man so much, more than anything in the world and I wanted him in my life forever. I realized I can live life for myself and l can commit to things for my own sake. I had brought it up to him that maybe we could entertain officially putting a label on it and that's when he said that he doesn't love me anymore. He said he feels numb to the idea of loving anyone or being with anyone. He says he wishes we spoke about this sooner and says he misses being in love with me but just says he only feels guilt for falling out of love. He said it might have to do with him trying for so long to no avail. He said he wants me in his life more than anything regardless and that he loves me as an individual very much. He said he needed space apart and that if he felt anything he wouldn't fight it or shove it down. I am hesitantly giving him his space after having bothered him so much in between due to my overthinking. Last time we spoke he said he feels like he's dead while living. He says he feels really depressed and mentioned he feels like his life is a couple months from falling apart.

I can go on about all the traumatic things Iv witness but I must say that my father is a good man. We all love him and he loves us. He tries so hard to help if he can, listens, and supports us. Still the pain can make him mean, and other times he will just hide in his room crying.

Few days ago he went for a ride on his electric scooter, its not uncommon since he like to get fresh air and out of his room. After a hour he still didn't return, he wasn't answering his phone, and well I knew something was wrong. Turns out he went to try and drink himself to death, he was hiding behind my dead aunts vacant home, in the cold wet ground. Kept saying he was just a burden on us and he is tired of the pain.

If I never sprung to action there is a good chance he would be dead and I wish he was.

1jlzy85,2025-03-28T18:04:11,"Medication recommendation - highly sensitive to side effects


I‚Äôm F24, have a diagnosis of moderate-severe depression, OCD, C-PTSD, and previously, eating disorder behaviors.
In April 2023, I started on sertraline (Zoloft) for 1.5 years but tapered off (less effective over time, problems with temp regulation and sexual dysfunction). I worked up to 150mg in hopes it would also help with OCD, but it didn‚Äôt seem to. I was also started on buspar and propranolol for acute anxiety caused primarily by C-PTSD triggers, and still use these two. Hydroxyzine was used for a little while but knocked me out during the day ‚Äî I just wanted to sleep.
I was off antidepressants for a few months after tapering off sertraline (Zoloft) but eventually wounded up needing them again. We tried Desvenlafaxine (Pristiq) due to less side effects, which at 25mg didn‚Äôt seem to do much for me, but when increased to 50mg, gave me severely debilitating depression and suicidal ideation. Immediately stopped when that occurred and went to a psychiatrist to figure out next steps (previously just prescribed by PCP).
He recommended starting on Auvelity due to my previous sensitivity to medication and overall tolerance not being great. I took 1 pill a day from 3/7 to 3/19, and then one every other day starting on 3/21. I would have strong side effects about 2 hours after taking the dose which would last for 3-4 hours. This included:
- Euphoria / psychoactive, high-like state
- Short term memory loss
- Inability to focus/concentrate on tasks
- Communication affected due to memory/losing track of conversation
- Increased heartrate, especially after short burst of physical activity (such as going up one flight of stairs‚Äî I was completely winded and felt like I had run a mile)
- Occasional shortness of breath
- Increased anxiety and ruminations (worsening C-PTSD and OCD symptoms as a result) 

My overall depression was great and I felt way more motivated than ever, but unfortunately it wasn‚Äôt a great fit due to these other reasons. My psychiatrist suspected I was a rapid metabolizer for the medication (reasoning for trying the switch to every other day) but it wasn‚Äôt a great fit, since that only amplified the side effects during the hours it peaked. 

We are trying to see if I can get covered to try Trintellix next, but are still in the waiting period to get that sorted out. Chances seem to be slim ‚Äî I‚Äôve looked into the Takeda program to help but may not qualify.

I have been off the Auvelity since taking the last dose on 3/25. Yesterday (3/27) I experienced ‚Äúbrain zaps‚Äù (felt like tiny electrical shocks to my brain), was disoriented and dizzy, and extremely fatigued. I‚Äôm still fairly disoriented and don‚Äôt recall how I got from point A to B at times, and mostly just extremely tired. I‚Äôm already surprised I experienced withdrawal just after 2 days of the last dose, especially since I had only been on Auvelity for 2.5 weeks. 

If anyone has any input on how to get over the withdrawal period and advice on possible medications moving forward given my history, that would be greatly appreciated (in case Trintellix is not financially feasible). An option he suggested was Viibryd, but upon doing some research and talking to my therapist, she thinks my sensitivity is so high that it would be a tier 2 med and might not be the best idea. The Wellbutrin was brought up, but the concern is the anxiety since Auvelity heightened it, possibly due to the bupropion. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable trying an SNRI given the SI that came with the desvenlafaxine/Pristiq. Maybe Lexapro?

1jlv417,2025-03-28T14:30:14,"Venlafaxine/Effexor and Severe Anhedonia
Hello, 28M here. I started on 150mg Venlafaxine back in October 2024 after battling anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. Things slowly started to get better and after plateauing in January of this year, I decided to move up to 187.5mg after a meeting with my psychiatrist, to see if I could benefit anymore from an increased dose. After two weeks, I then decided to move up to 225mg. I've been on 225mg from 5th March to present day.

However, that's where things have very much deteriorated. I currently feel nothing, literally nothing. I feel numb, no pleasure with anything that I used to love doing. This is in turn having an effect on my relationship with my fiancee (who I am set to marry later this year). I don't enjoy doing my music, or watching TV, or listening to the shows I used to enjoy, or spending time with my fiancee. Which is all pretty scary, and it constantly sends me into a spiral, where I have now experienced suicidal ideation. I am currently also having therapy, but I just feel so numb, desperate, and stuck.

1jlywpc,2025-03-28T17:19:47,"I don't want to get better anymore
I have chronic health issues and had a setback two years ago. And I'm dealing with many other things as well.

The most important thing I've done with my life is some years of college. I should be grateful about that (I am, to some extent). I should think of it as evidence that life CAN be good sometimes. That life has ups and downs and it won't always be bad. That I'm finally learning to appreciate what I had before I got sick... 

But it does not ""put things into perspective"". I can't think ""wow, I realize now how lucky I was back then"". Cause I was actually miserable in college. I remember being so excited to get into my favorite college, like I could rest after that accomplishment. But then realizing I'm still miserable even when I got to that point in life... At college I was in the middle of trying to improve my life. I WAS improving, and I'm proud of myself. But then my chronic illness went from mild to completely debilitating. NOW I'm trying with all my strength just to get back to that point again, where I wasn't even happy. I don't want to settle for recovering just enough so I can manage to go to college/work, but not have energy left to have fun. I've been there already.

I am grateful. But it's also like surviving on crumbs of happiness. And some people say ""hey look at those other people ‚Äî homeless, terminally ill, etc. They have it worse than you"". But it doesn't make me feel better. It just sounds like they're saying ""why are you expecting something better? You should be going through what those other people are going through but you're lucky you're not. Be grateful because if it's not *this* situation you're in, then it's that other worse situation."" Why do I have to focus on people who have it worse in order to feel better? There's people who have it worse, AND there's people who have it better. Ok so??? I wouldn't dare telIt doesn't change anything. My feelings are not an irrational outlook on life, it's based on real objectively bad experiences, whether I choose to be optimistic or pessimistic. I feel like my depression is largely due to physical illness and circumstances and being unable to take proper take care of myself.

All the effort that I've put in to every part of my life is disproportionate to the outcome. It feels like too little too late. For example: I've been trying to get disability transportation for 6 months. I'm going to apply one last time. But if I'm accepted, it won't compensate for those 6 months of mostly isolation since I first applied. I'm also trying something new for my health, so by the time I get transportation it might actually be when I no longer need it. AND, I feel like public transportation isn't something most people even think about where I live. Why did I fight so hard for something that most people just take for granted? Why do I not deserve to take this for granted and feel safe knowing that this is something that I won't ever have to lack? Why does my gratitude always involve knowing that something I have will be taken away at any moment? Obviously many people feel this way. I'm not saying I'm special and more entitled than them. I think everyone deserves to feel some level of safety and stability.

If I were to get better from my depression, I still have to deal with my physical health which is difficult to manage, endless responsibilities, my lack of life experiences, building my personality without depression, my low self-confidence, my body image, financial issues, loans. I have to go fix all of this before I can even dream of work or school, otherwise I will fail like the last time and maybe have an even worse health setback. I also need to resolve things with my friends and family... I would have to accept how all my issues have shaped my identity, and how I lost my youth to all these problems. I went from 12 to 19 to 28 so quickly. Then I'll be 40 before I know it.

I have a few days/weeks each year where I am not depressed. And I look around and think: ""Ok what now?"". Nothing about my situation is different even when I'm calm and optimistic. I get hopeful and try to improve. I think that *maybe* I can start moving on from depression, but then I get depressed again. Or if one thing gets a bit better, something else starts falling apart.

I don't want to get better anymore. It's one struggle after another. At every stage in life, it's just a different form of suffering.

After that i tried working as a freelance graphic designer but its really like a sisyphus thing, made some works and got some money but that in the long way resulted in a burnout and me starting to hate everything i create and ultimately my passion.

For years I've struggled making friends. I just never thought people really understood me and found it really hard to be myself with others given i have social anxiety and self worth issues. This was until around 7 months ago, when I met a group of people who I genuinely thought I got along really well with, and who became really close to over the last 7 months. Even just 3 days ago, I felt extremely secure in my friendships, I had plans with the group coming up, and many people from the group had even been contacting me trying to initiate 1 on 1 plans (which is really rare and special for me). This was until yesterday, when they all mass blocked me on every platform imaginable. I have no idea why and as far as I'm aware ive done nothing wrong. 

Since this ive been at the worst point in my life, contemplating suicide, abusing substances and self harming. I have no idea what to do and am just at a loss. I've tried contacting my doctor to get help as soon as possible because im scared of what I might do to myself but I havent been able to see her yet.

1jlpj6k,2025-03-28T08:23:05,"My Shoulders are Heavy
I've been working the same job for four years. I've been living with my best friend for almost 2. My life is mostly pretty good. I make a decent amount for what I do, I love my job and everything it entails, and I have amazing friends and family. I'm incredibyl lucky and I love what I've fought to build for myself.

I don't have energy anymore. Whether it be from working all day or the chronic pain I live with or the mental illnesses I have, I just don't have energy. I get home, I see all the things I have to do (laundry, dishes, tidying up, taking out the trash, etc) and I freeze. I just freeze because I don't have the energy, so I play a game or laying in bed for hours. And then I feel horrible because I can't make myself get up and do those things. It doesn't help that my best friend that I live with points this out and then points out that the reason she doesn't ask for help anymore is because I take too much time to recover afterwards.

I'm just exhausted. My grandmother is getting older and we have to move her into a retirement facility. My weekends are spent helping with that or taking my roommate to work because she doesn't have a car. I don't mind doing that. I'm just so tired. I don't have any motivation.

I want to engage in my hobbies. I love to write and build with LEGO and hang out with my dad for hours watching stupid movies. I want to learn to crochet again or try punch needling or something, but I'm just so. Damn. Tired.

I feel like I'm everyone's emotional crutch. I've always been the person you can go to for things and I love being important in people's lives, but when I have my own issues it feels like I'm weighing them down. The only person I can truly say that has never made me feel that way is my father, and it hurts that even though I only live three miles away from him now, I only see him a couple times a month. I knew I'd miss living at home but I really miss being able to walk into my dad's room and just get a big hug.

Sometimes I can't tell if I'm tired or depressed. Hell, I didn't even think my depression was getting this bad again until getting into multiple fights with my roommate in the last couple weeks. It makes me think that all the horrible things my abusive mother used to tell me are right. It makes me think that I'm worthless and all I do is drag people around me down and that I will never amount to anything and I can't do anything right.

When I was a teenager I used to imagine going to sleep and never waking up. Sometimes, on the way into the city, I'd imagine a semi truck falling on the car and crushing only me to death, sparing my dad and brother. I used to think about how easy it would be for the people in my life if I just didn't exist. If I didn't have to be someone else to worry about. Maybe my brother's mental illnesses could've been treated better in his youth if I wasn't around. Maybe my mother wouldn't have turned out the way she did if she only had my brother and not me. Maybe it's all my fault. Maybe I'm just not worth it.

I haven't thought about that in a long time. I haven't dreamt about driving off the edge of a cliff or into a tree in years. I haven't even thought about hurting myself in any meaningful way in almost a decade. It's been so long without passive suicidal ideation that I think it crept back up on me and I found a way to normalise it again like I did when I was a kid.

I thought that having a decent job and living on my own and having a car meant that I had done something good. I thought that all of the little achievement that make me happy (when I let them) are important. I thought that I was important.

My mom left when I was 15. Four days after my birthday. I was a freshman in high school. The one person meant to love me forever just left because she wasn't happy. But she wanted my brother. Just not me. I was the firstborn and I wasn't wanted by own mother. She used to hit me because I didn't do the dishes right or because I didn't fold the laundry right. But she wanted to be my best friend. Until I did something wrong. And then I got hit.

I wasn't sad when she left. Every one around me was sad for me, but I didn't mourn the loss. She hadn't ever really been my mother to begin with. She was just the woman that gave birth to me. My dad is the only one who has ever looked out for me. It's always only been my dad. At least I have him. Unless my brother's mental illnesses are flaring up again, then we all have to worry about him. And no one worries about me. No one asks how I am. No one sees what's up with me. No one worries. Because I don't let them.

I don't know if they really think that I'm as okay as I say I am. Sometimes I think that they talk about me, wondering just how much I'm hiding away from them. My dad knows basically every dark thought I've ever had, but I've spent years being better. I'm better. I'm better now. I'm not a kid and I'm better.

I need to be better. I can't go back. I can't do this again. I can't learn to love myself all over again. I already did that. I already did the fucking work. I already worked with therapists and increased my dosage and tried so fucking hard to like the person in the mirror. And I do like her most of the time. I'm proud of what she's done. I might not have gone to college but I matter to the people around me. I might not be remembered in history for anything meaningful, but my family will remember me. My friends will. Right? I've done enough to live on in some way, right?

Because I'm so alone. I'm so horribly alone. And I like to be alone. I almost never feel lonely. I like sitting in my room all day away from people. I like laying in bed and doom scrolling online. I like playing with my LEGO or Minecraft. I like writing with my friends across the world. I like to be alone. I think it's important for me to be able to be alone. But, God, I'm so fucking alone. No one's ever been in love with me. I haven't tried hard enough ever since a stupid fucking boy said yes to going out with me and then ignored me for the rest of my life. I gave up at 17 and I'm almost 30. I'm so alone.

I'm just tired. I'm tired of doing everything wrong. I'm tired of not being enough. I'm tired of being lied to. I'm tired of not being able to clean my desk off so I can finish building the set I got for my birthday last year. I'm so tired all the time. And everything hurts. My whole body hurts. My heart hurts, my lungs hurt, my back hurts, my hips hurt, my feet hurt. Everything hurts and I'm so tired of being in so much pain all the time. I'm tired of laying in bed all day because it hurts to get up. I'm tired. I'm tired.

I'm tired.

I'm just tired. And a lot more depressed than I realised. The building I work at is being bought out by another company and once that's all finalised I'll have insurance again. Then I'll be able to find out what's wrong with my foot, maybe I'll be able to see a chiropractor again to help my back and hip pain. And, most importantly, I'll have access to fucking mental health care. I've had persistent depression for as long as I can remember, but I was first diagnosed at 16. That therapist told me I'd probably had it since I was in 6th grade. And I have PTSD from my mom and it doesn't help that I keep hearing about her from my brother, who is still in contact with her.

Maybe I'm just going through one of those super fun bouts of major depression. I was this depressed last Thursday, but I hadn't felt it at all again until tonight. Both nights I had a kind of fight with my roommate. Maybe I'm just depressed because I know I've hurt her by not being enough for her in our living arrangement.

I'm tired and I'm going to go to sleep and tomorrow I will wake up. Tomorrow I will wake up and I will find the strength to get out of bed and doing something.

1jlnlmd,2025-03-28T06:06:49,"My best friend was murdered and I no longer want to live
i dont know where to start or why im even here typing this, i guess i just want to be able to get some things off my chest. Im currently 26 years old and ill start by trying to understand myself and tell you why it is that i feel how i feel. In august 2019 my closest friend was stabbed and murdered after a brawl erupted. The details of this is very important and play a big part as my friend essentially died as he was trying to protect another one of our friends who was being chased by the attacker. The person he was defending and a few other friends that was there at the time went back to my friends mothers house to tell her what had happened but apparently told his mother that 'he had been stabbed but he will be okay'. At the point of them telling her this he was already dead which lead to ongoing disputes and fallouts between my friend who died family and my friends. This and many other things that my friends done surrounding the situation led to me distancing myself from my friend group which was VERY close and left me feeling like I had no real friends left and was on my own. I was not present on the night and went to the house the next morning when I found out but the situation was too overwelming for me and I went back home where I live with my mother and little brother who was away for the week so my sister came to my house to offer me some support. At this time however me and my sister was not seeing eye to eye for some years leading up to this which put me in a position where I really needed the support however did not want the support from her which was making me feel worse. 

  
The last conversation i had with my friend who passed was only hours before he passed where he invited me to the party which he died at with me not being able to go due to it being my other little brothers birthday party on the same day so instead we spoke about going to Notting Hill carnival the next day which was something we had planned to do since the year before and was very excited about. The mixture of this and the fact that my mother was not there to support me, only my sister who at the time i did not like at all lead me to make the decision that my friend would not want me to be sitting in my house crying all day like i was and that he would want me to go and enjoy myself at carnival like me and him had planned to do. 

  
That decision to go and 'party' on the day my best friend was murdered and all of his family were grieveing was and still is my biggest regret of my life and was the start of me losing the will to live.

  
In the months following his death I was still almost functioning as nothing had happened but then covid 19 happened and we was all on lockdown for roughly 2 years and during this time period with a lot of time to sit and think it started to settle and become more real that id never see him again. Between the grieveing and the inability to live a 'normal' life due to lockdown my mental health started to rapidly deteriorate with me losing the will to do simple daily tasks leading to me ruining the somewhat successful buisness I had created and spending all of my savings. I would literally roll out of bed to my pc screen and back to bed, was smoking weed like crazy and honestly just living like a basement dweller and telling myself it was not a problem becuase of lockdown. I also enrolled to university at this time which i used to further justify how I was living telling myself 'this is how all students live anyway' but I did not understand at the time how much it was keeping me physically and mentally occupied and when i graduated in 2023 I was left lost not knowing what to do with myself, nothing in life seemed worth it anymore. 



The past 2 years has been the worst and longest years of my life, ive ALMOST given up hope that i will ever be able to be 'okay' again.. i just cant see a way out, ive stopped caring about making money which has put me in about 2k debt which may not seem like alot but when i cant even last a week at a job without just sraight up switching my phone off and staying in bed all day it seems 1 step forward 2 steps back at every interval. Ive let go of my physical apearance, I hardly leave my house, i dont check up on ANY family or friends. Although I wouldnt necessarily say im suicidal, I really struggle to find long term reason and motivation to live, nothing seems fun, nothing seems worth it I just dont know anymore

1jlnjoe,2025-03-28T06:03:15,"I‚Äôm thinking of ending my life now
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm worth anything. I hate myself. No matter how hard I push, no matter how much I try to be smart, to be perfect, anxiety always gets in the way. It paralyzes me, makes even the simplest things feel impossible. For weeks, I‚Äôve been forcing myself to keep going, chasing perfect grades, because I have to, I‚Äôm studying fashion design in college, and graduation is just around the corner. On top of my classes, I‚Äôm making five looks, a project that‚Äôs been consuming my life. Those looks will be showcased at graduation, and I‚Äôve been pouring everything into them. But the stress has been overwhelming. I barely have time for anything, not even to eat some days. Still, there was a moment, a brief one, where I started to feel better. My looks were coming together beautifully. I was even a little excited, imagining myself modeling them, seeing my work come to life. But then, everything came crashing down. I found out I need to secure an internship with a company for at least four months in order to graduate. And in that moment, I felt like I was going to explode. What was all of this for? The time, the money, the stress, the anxiety, was it all wasted? I pushed myself to keep going, to be better, even when my anxiety made my voice tremble during presentations, even when I wanted to give up and cried myself to sleep. I kept fighting. And for what? Now, I might not even graduate. The thing I once loved, fashion design, has turned into my greatest fear, my biggest source of anxiety. I don‚Äôt think I can do this anymore.

I‚Äôm only 21 but I feel broken. Devastated. And worst of all, I feel like a burden to my family. I don‚Äôt work, I don‚Äôt contribute, and I know they had high expectations for me. But I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ nothing. No matter how hard I try, I can‚Äôt seem to accomplish anything. My emotions exhaust them, when I open up, they either get mad at me or make me cry. But all I really need is support. A hug. Something to remind me that I‚Äôm not alone. I feel like I‚Äôm not good enough, so I‚Äôve been punishing myself by not eating. Even smiling or laughing makes me feel guilty, like I don‚Äôt deserve anything good right now.

I‚Äôve had thoughts of ending my life before. But I always held on, thinking about my family, how much they‚Äôve given me, how much I owe them. I kept going for them, for my friends, for the people who believe in me. But never for myself.

And now‚Ä¶ now I feel so broken inside. The weight of it is unbearable. Living hurts more than anything. And I don‚Äôt know how to keep going. Dying feels like the only relief. I‚Äôm really sorry

1jlnaq4,2025-03-28T05:47:48,"Spacing out with friends
I've been having a difficult time lately. My depression has somewhat reappeared after a very solid 18 months. Initially I thought I was having an off day, then an off week, and now it's been a few months of low-grade high functioning depression‚Äîmanageable‚Äîuntil the past couple weeks where it's kicked up a notch. I'm a final semester college student, and I know that this is definitely not helping the situation. 

Anyway, I've been trying to get ahead of this by hanging out with friends in short increments. All I want to do is isolate. When I'm interested in talking, it's texting one or two specific people (who don't go to school with me). But, at the same time I'm aware that isolation makes me feel worse, so as much as I whine to myself about actually doing stuff, I've been trying to see friends. Tonight, there was a picnic which I went to with two friends. It was nice I guess. I just felt overwhelmed with all the other people around, and the sun, and the messy food. My friends would be talking and I would just completely zone out. It was like I was unable to focus on more than one thing. My thoughts would get too loud, or a squirrel would run past us, and my mind would exit the building. I feel terrible about it. I'm not normally like this at all. My mind just isn't right right now, and it's hard for me to drag my focus away from that.

I've thought about telling them what's going on, and apologizing, but I'm honestly mortified at the thought of telling them I am depressed. These friends have known me for, you guessed it, about 18 months. So, they don't know me as a depressed person. I don't want them to look at me differently‚Äîthey would. I don't want their sympathy. I don't want anyone to worry about me‚ÄîI don't want to be asked ""how are you feeling?"" by my friend every day. I just want to deal with my depression in my own way. 

But, now I'm not sure if meeting with friends is worthwhile. If I'm going to be weird and spacey every time, I'm going to ruminate on it afterwards too. I don't know if that's better or worse than isolation. God, I just want to isolate. If anyone has experienced this feeling of ""spacing out"" 0r has any advice on how to approach friends while my mind is  distracting me, I'm all ears.

I've been fighting my bad depression and anxiety for so many years, but it's hit a low lately. I just need to feel like I'm not completely invisible for a change. I've never been popular, never been attractive, and now that I'm pushing 40, it feels like I'm out of time to fix whatever character flaws are making my everyday existence so difficult.

At my job, I've been bullied for the past three years by a coworker who has no respect for me. She makes me feel like I've been thrust back to the 7th grade. She monopolized my relationship with my only friend amongst my coworkers, and now I never get to talk to them. She's made for a very hostile work environment, but we're so understaffed, my supervisor won't do anything about it because we need her. I'm trans and closeted, though my transition is very obvious, and it's hard not to think a lot of her ire comes from bigotry.

Creatively, my work is failing. I got some writing work picked up by small press, and lit mags, and blogs, and I can't get anyone to read them. What's the point of fighting so hard to get things accepted if nobody celebrates when you're successful? I see people whine on social media about their failed book signings and get hundreds to thousands of likes and attention for their woes - - but my book signing was a flop, too, because my publisher dropped the damn ball, but I feel like if I say something, I'll be making an ass of myself. So I keep my sadness to myself for the most part - that doesn't mean it doesn't all hurt. My qualms of appearing like a big baby have probably cost me a lot of opportunities because I don't outright talk about how shitty my circumstance is. I have a kickstarter for my next novel with a very modest goal, less than a week left, and that's failing, too - despite the project itself getting a lot of hype when I posted about it in a different context earlier. People are great at lip service but not so much at putting their actual support down in a way that counts.

The publishing BS is all wrapped up in my failed relationship with my small press - I pulled the second novel from them after a disastrous experience with my debut, and now I feel like they're trying to sabotage me on purpose because they're mad I addressed how bad their process is. It's supposed to be a business; I shouldn't feel guilty telling my publisher that they didn't hold up their end of the bargain.

I have multiple sclerosis, and it's getting worse. I don't talk about how I'm blind in one eye, or how I'm weak on my left side, or how my shakes have gotten worse. My muscle spasms are painful and disruptive to pretty much everything I do. I used to be really good at things like word puzzles, and now I can't do them half as well as I used to. My faculties are diminishing. It's terrifying. But my MS is invisible - nobody can see it, and people just think I'm lazy for not being super active - they just don't understand that I can't do certain things anymore. I have limits. I'm disabled. The fact I'm not in a wheelchair yet doesn't make my disability any less real.

This sub in general is very triggering for me because my mother took her own life 9 years ago. I really struggle with knowing how close I feel to hurting myself. I want to self-destruct because I feel like nobody will notice. And, of course, I know logically that's crap, because I am a parent and a spouse and a sibling. I wouldn't do to my kids what my mom did to me. But it certainly is an appealing way out when everything else is falling apart.

I wish I could break.

I‚Äôm a high schooler who has just begun life, I have a few close friends, gets bullied in school, has an emotionally and financially abusive mom, and a friend who is commonly suicidal. I have big dreams and often don‚Äôt think I will be able to achieve them. I know that my life is a lot better than others, and, in a lot of respects, I am lucky, but it feels like this life is either going to be wasted or miserable. I feel like I have already lived too long and seen too much.

Two years ago I lost my mom to what I now believe was a suicide. I was only 22. I found her. I lived with her my whole life, in our apartment. Her landlords gave me 30 days to leave after I told them what had happened. I didn‚Äôt have a job, I didn‚Äôt have a mother, I didn‚Äôt have anywhere to go, I didn‚Äôt have any money. I ended up having to leave 90% of our belongings behind. I have severe PTSD from this experience that has left me with insomnia, crippling anxiety, depression, and an eating disorder. 

I ended up moving into my dad‚Äôs house since I didn‚Äôt have anywhere to go. Growing up we didn‚Äôt really have a relationship and his house (that he shares with my estranged brother) is absolutely filthy. My brother leaves garbage and filth on the floors and kitchen table, countertops, bathroom, anywhere he goes. His dog pees and poops in the house. They both chain smoke cigarettes in the house. My dad works full time but my brother is 30 and doesn‚Äôt have a job, he just lives rent free and makes the conditions unlivable. You have to wear shoes in the house, it stinks, there‚Äôs cobwebs everywhere and dog hair and garbage and dirty dishes and food left out. 
I do not live this way. I live in my bedroom and only leave if i absolutely must use the bathroom or eat. My brother has never washed dishes a day in his life and expects me to. My dad and him are both extremely emotionally volatile so I avoid them the best I can and return to my bedroom as much as I can. 

The point of this post is that I am so depressed, traumatized, angry, hurt, and stressed that I have contemplated offing myself. I was in a horrific car accident a few months back that I survived, and that also left me with more PTSD and general unhappiness. I cannot afford to move out, I don‚Äôt get paid enough, there are no other jobs that will pay more. I have finally alienated all of my friends so I can be left alone for good. 

I‚Äôm starting to question if my life is redeemable. How do I get through this? I have lived here for two years now and I am completely and utterly alone.

I don‚Äôt have that, I just feel like a massive burden on everything and everyone and don‚Äôt want to live anymore because it‚Äôs too much.

This isn‚Äôt a one off thing either, every thing I‚Äôve done to better myself has made me feel miserable.

1jlgi0m,2025-03-28T00:01:55,"thank you to anyone who reads this
I feel like I‚Äôm going to lose my mind. I wish I had friends to go out with, people who would give me courage and experience life with me so I wouldn‚Äôt be so nervous. I know I can only blame myself, but I‚Äôm just so upset. I wish things were different for me.

Today, my sister told me that my mom wanted to talk to me about something, but she acted weird about it, like she didn‚Äôt want to say what it was about even though i kinda already knew. When I went to see what my mom wanted and sat on the couch, she started talking about how i will need to do more chores/cleaning now that my sister would be working soon and wouldn‚Äôt be home much anymore because of high school, college courses, programs, and work. I already figured that would happen. It just makes sense.

But then my sister came downstairs and just stood there listening, even though, to my knowledge, my mom had only asked to speak to me. It made me uncomfortable. Then my mom started saying how I don‚Äôt do anything, how she works, how my sister does a lot, and then asked, ‚ÄúDo you think taking on more chores is too much for you?‚Äù Like‚Ä¶ what? Of course not. But the way she says it, I just sit at home doing nothing, hurt. I know it‚Äôs true, and I hate it. Every day, I feel sad about it. Every night, I think about it. But when I try to express that, my mom just says I‚Äôm being defensive. The way she talks down to me makes me feel so small, and my younger sister just stood there listening. Then my mom said the conversation was for both of us, but everything she was saying was directed at me.

I always wanted to go to college. Ever since I was 15, I dreamed about it. I‚Äôd watch YouTube videos of freshmen sharing their experiences and think, maybe someday that‚Äôll be me. But it wasn‚Äôt. I spent the last few years of my life inside my room.

I had so many dreams traveling with friends, going out on holidays and summer breaks, visiting cafes and malls together but none of it ever happened. I didn‚Äôt make it happen for myself. I wish I had someone to do it all with, someone to push me, and I‚Äôd push them too. It‚Äôs less scary when you‚Äôre not alone.

But a huge part of why I feel this way, why I have so much anxiety, is because of my weight. I‚Äôve been insecure about it for as long as I can remember, but now it affects me more than ever. I don‚Äôt even like going places because I feel ashamed, like people are judging me. I feel like I can‚Äôt live unless I lose weight. I wanted to be that beautiful girl in college, the one with friends and a life, but I‚Äôm not. I know I‚Äôm too sensitive, I know I lack discipline, and I know I‚Äôm not strong enough for this world.

Hi Everyone,
I suppose I'm asking for help or just that I'm not alone (and warning it's a long rant). I (30F), feel like I'm stuck in a cycle and I have no-one I can talk honestly to.

I've been depressed for most of my life around 20 years, suicidal for 15, but have only recently become enraged. Anger and rage is quite triggering for me, as I've never seen anger managed correctly. So I have so much anger I feel like I choke on it, but no idea how to work through it but also the urge to try and shove it aside.

I was a good kid, I got okay grades and at my parents insistence I went to University and got two degrees while extremely ill. However as soon as I finished the last degree, I broke and I've never healed. Fast forward to now and I've had over 500 refusals for jobs I have been honestly over qualified in, and countless more for jobs that would have suited. I cannot get a job, at which point I cannot have a partner or a family. I do not have access to benefits so I am in debt, my pensioner mother has to pay for everything.

Which leads me to the point of: Why on earth would doctors/paramedics/nurses/social workers and family want you to stop trying to end your life when it holds nothing but misery? When you see childhood friends have things you will never have?

Why should I 'Keep fighting', when I have nothing to fight for?

I will just make a list of reasons why I am like this now because I think it is fucking crazy and wonder if I'm in hell. I won't go too much in detail for each reason don't worry 

For starters, I have OCD which is a really damning condition to have. 
My dad doesn't live with me and hardly talks to me. Instead, he has another family who I get to see have much better lives than me.
My mom is terminally ill and I barely had her help when I was a kid.
My half brother and mom used to abuse me when I was a small kid
No family or friends that I can hang out with or talk to
I'm dirt poor, so of course my teeth are in bad shape and I hardly eat any food
I was homeless for a few years as a kid due to being so poor
No girlfriend ever obviously 
Since I barely eat, I am so skinny that occasionally people think I'm anorexic, which is annoying because I definitely ain't.

That's the main stuff I remember. My only saving grace is that genetically I seem kinda gifted. It's funny though because it seems like it will go to waste. I'm hoping I can move out to college next fall and maybe restart there. However, I don't have any willpower anymore and just want a bullet to my brain.

1jmfigb,2025-03-29T06:37:11,"Actually, it doesn't get better
Idk if i need to put a tw, but tw for CSA. üëç

I have been legitimately suicidal since I was 10. The first time I tried to kill myself, I was 11. I was sexually assaulted by a stranger a few months before and had just graduated fifth grade. I planned to hang myself and brought a pocket knife with me planning to stab myself if it took too long. Survival instincts ended up kicking in, and I think I ended up using that knife to hack at the thin rope I used enough that I fell onto the ground, blacked out for a second, and ultimately failed. The actual events are hazy, but I still remember taking the frayed noose to the Dumpster.

After that, I resolved that I would die when I was 16-18. I'm not proud of it, but I willingly began relationships with online predators when I was 11-14 and had it ingrained in me that once I became an adult, I was past my prime, undesirable. There are probably (thankfully faceless) swimsuit photos of me from back then that are still floating around on the Internet somewhere, and I hate myself so much for providing them to legitimate sickos. The second time I was physically molested, I was consciously asking for it. 

My mom also became physically and emotionally abusive when I hit puberty and developed chronic illnesses (independently of the other stuff). Since elementary school, I have idolized the idea of dying pretty and young and by my own volition. I have been bullied for being autistic for all of high school, but held on to this notion that at least people will pretend to have liked me when I'm dead. I've tried to kill myself at least once a year, it's almost tradition. ""It gets better,"" ""Most people change their minds in a year,"" ""This too shall pass,"" etc; my ass. A million pills and appointments and therapy methods later, and I've only found rock bottoms I didn't know could exist.

Well, I'm now 18. As of today, I have officially been rejected or waitlisted from every college I applied to and could afford, despite having a 1550 SAT/35 ACT, being valedictorian, taking a fuckton of APs, etcetc (and no, I didn't even bother with the Ivies, these were mostly state schools). Even though I would have had to pay my own tuition, college was supposed to be my new start away from my abusive mom, dysfunctional family, and high school bullies. I will possibly be homeless in August and community college is not a viable option for this reason. I have zero savings from my old job because I had to pay for my test fees and college applications myself. I have applied to over 50 new jobs, but haven't been hired since I'm in HS and don't have a car. Even so, I don't think I could even keep up with a minimum wage food service job since my mind is at a point where I hardly take care of my hygiene.

For the past eight years, I've just been waking up to go back to sleep again‚Äîgoddamn, if there was one thing I loved, it was sleeping. I can't bear another day at this point, but I'm scared I'll fuck up killing myself again and rack up medical debt that my mom will give me shit for. I'm still paying the price for my involuntary hold last year and for nearly succeeding at starving myself three years before that. If she ends up finding this, she'll probably seize all of my stuff again and I won't even have my special interests to distract me.

Tonight, I'm thinking about my younger self and how I've failed her by surviving this long. I don't want it to hurt too much. I'm already in so much pain. I want it to be light and gauzy and downy and gentle and kind. I'm here on this sub trying to determine the best way to do it like I have countless times over the years. I'm so tired.

1jmepzk,2025-03-29T05:44:57,"Please don‚Äôt be sad i‚Äôm dead. I died a long time ago - the only thing present was my body.
I am probably going to delete this, i‚Äôm not sure yet - but I feel I needed to scream this somewhere, anywhere. 

Why do i feel like everything and nothing at the same time - is this how it feels to be 22? I‚Äôll be 23 on Monday, and the idea of entering and exiting on the same date, at the same time - seems relieving. 

My shoulders are heavy from carrying the burden of life on my shoulders, every day it weighs down a bit more. I think my legs are starting to give out. 

Yes I am scared, but ultimately the pain of living has started to outweigh the pain of dying. I remember when I would be suicidal, but the thoughts of leaving loved ones behind - and little things such as watching my favorite shows, or petting my cat strayed me away. ‚ÄúOh gosh, if i died I wouldn‚Äôt be able to get Starbucks anymore!‚Äù Stupid things. 

Not anymore. 

I‚Äôve become what they classify us as ‚Äúselfish‚Äù. I simply do not care how the tower will fall after i‚Äôm gone. It could burn and blow up for all I care. I do not care that everything will pause in place; my apple watch still on the charger, my Roomba scheduled to vacuum at 6am, my half drunken water bottle on my dresser waiting for another sip; none of this stupidity once my soul has departed from this Earth.  

I even have a son, he‚Äôs 4. I‚Äôve done my best to shield these horrors from him, but he does not deserve to live around a lie - an imposter of what should be his mother. I do feel like I have done my best to protect him and not impose these horrifying days onto him. I have tried my best, but ultimately I do feel he deserves better. He deserves someone who is stable, who is promising, who is capable. 

I know they will say I was not, but there is no way in hell I was not a burden to those around me. They will always deny that, maybe to comfort theirselves more than me, but I know dealing with me has been a front row seat on a rollercoaster to hell. They will deny it, but I know I have burdened people in ways they might not even fathom - because dealing with this is inevitably traumatizing for all parties involved that witness it firsthand. Let‚Äôs face that, and admit it. 

I‚Äôve cried for help, I have gotten help, i‚Äôve attempted before, I have been inpatient and outpatient, on medications, diagnosed, and still hopeless. It‚Äôs like throwing resolutions into an infinite black hole, it never fills up - it never will be whole. 

They say money buys happiness, I used to agree - but I digress, at least for me it has not. Yes, it can alleviate so many problems that can contribute to happiness, but it will never be the factor that sets a stable foundation of self. You see, this here is an internal issue - My soul is broken beyond repair. How much does it cost to repair that? It costs my life apparently. 

You take a plate and you throw it on the ground and it shatters, yes you can sit there for weeks and repair it but it will never be the same. Look at it, taped together and still shattered, even missing those tiny pieces of glass that would have technically made it a whole plate again - ‚Äúfixed‚Äù but still broken to the naked eye. 

I question what I could have done differently, or would have - until I started to realize some people are dealt shitty cards. Yes, some people with shitty cards still play their hand and win the game - but there‚Äôs a few select who have the ultimate shitty cards dealt, that just get progressively worse the more they play, and when we play a card game - someone has to lose right? I never played a game where everyone won. Someone has to lose. It‚Äôs as if it was just destined fate. 

I think that‚Äôs me. I have a hard time believing it‚Äôs me, 
out of all people me? 

I‚Äôve been through all the traumatic things you could possibly think of in my short two decades of a life. Friends dying, being raped, being molested, father in jail, mentally unstable mother, SW, addiction, mental illness, poverty, all the fun things under the sun that are so extensive if you think of anything else I‚Äôve probably experienced it - I‚Äôve just got tired of keeping track. 

I don‚Äôt know who I am screaming out to as I type this - But this is what I want to voice. I feel irreparable, I am spiraling, I am getting more comfortable with the thought. 

I plan on going to the Blue Ridge Parkway on my birthday, 3 hours away - where I won‚Äôt be able to be stopped and hopefully not found either, I don‚Äôt want to have someone deal with my body which was once harbored by a hurt soul, I would rather nature takes it course on me. No intervention. Just me and my fate.

I know they will question theirselves, I know they will be angry at me - unfortunately I won‚Äôt be here to answer to them and their never ending grief. I just hope they aren‚Äôt so hard on theirselves. I loved them, I‚Äôve enjoyed every second i‚Äôve spent with everyone, and I thank them for unconditionally showing up and dealing with me, even at the most inconvenient times. 

I was and am not insane, in fact I was clearheaded. I was living with a disease that only plummets further down the hole and I am choosing to die with dignity on my own terms - It‚Äôs the last and only thing I feel in control of, and I wear it with pride. 

This is my life and they say the truth will set you free, so I am cleaning out my closet. 

The weight has finally fallen off my shoulder.

1jmd4ov,2025-03-29T04:10:03,"Life is so unfair. I don‚Äôt wanna die, but what if its the last option?
Life is too hard for me, and it‚Äôs unfair. I grew up without any parental support. I never met my dad, mom died when I was just 11 years old. Granny adopted me since mom‚Äôs death, but we are not financially well off. I really wanted to have a college degree, so I work at night and study on day time. During the pandemic, grandma died, and the company where I worked closed. I don‚Äôt have money. I only relayed to the government‚Äôs support.

In 2021, as I wanted to fund my studies, I entered into an escort service. Most of my customers are gay men, some are women. I knew it‚Äôs illegal, it‚Äôs dangerous, but I want an easy money. Then I started earning money‚Ä¶ a lot of money. But I‚Äôm not happy to be an escort. I just really need it for money. I told to myself, one day, when I finish my studies, I will stop being an escort and will have a decent job.

Now, I‚Äôm already 24, and I felt ashamed that I am still a college student. Other people of my age are already young professionals. Me? Still a student and an escort at night and in the weekends. What a shame!

Last March 5, one regular client of mine booked my service. But my client set up me. He and his friends raped and tortured me and I almost died. They gave me a huge amount of money just to remain silent before they leave. The next thing I remember was when I am in the hospital. It‚Äôs very demoralizing.

Since the incident happened I stopped going to school. I cannot go to school with strangulation marks, bruises, eye blood-shots, and petechia. Yes, I will be a dropped out student again. 

Then, I started hating my self, my father who should be by my side, the government, my life as a whole. 

Today, I woke up crying and feeling empty. How I wish my rapist  had killed me. Or that I wasn‚Äôt found on time so I will die helpless. Life became so so harsh for me. Damn it!

I don‚Äôt wanna die, but also I don‚Äôt know how to live. I don‚Äôt know how to start. My inner self is telling me that the last option is to die. I‚Äôm giving myself 3 days to be okay.

my dad hs been nicer to me since i mentioned that something he said really stuck with me after my suicide attempt. it's been over a year but i still think about it so i talked to him about it. i remember it vividly, i asked him ""would you sent me to [terrible mh near us] if i attempted again?"" and he responded, ""i dont care where you go as long as you're alive"". my therapist used to work there and she said it was a terrible place. i texted him about how people say they only git worse after going. ifeel like the only reason he's been nice is because he doesn't want to lose me and he feels guilty and ive just been thinking about how i felt post attempt. the guilt, anger, depression post attempt. i don't think i could deal with all the pity, not again. but closing my eyes one last time sounds too appealing. i dont know how many ""just make it to [x]""'s i can do anymore. ive been thinking about doing it again but i don't think i could deal with looking at my dad again, the man who caused it all but cared the most. i just want to feel his love all the time, not just when im suicidal. its a vicious cycle of depression, anger, guilt, anxiety, and dissociation. the fact that people can tell and treat me differently. i wish i wasn't as broken as i am, i wish i could just put myself back together. i could live with the cracks, i already live with the scars. i don't want to be pitied anymore, i don't want people to feel sad for me. i don't know how to just feel okay, its like everytime i get better my thoughts lull me back into that pit of despair and self destructive behaviors. its like a siren's call that's too good to pass up. i take baby steps forwards, and then i tumble down the stairs backwards. i hate the self loathing and ""woe is me"", but its how i feel. i dont know why i can't be stable. it's like i was meant to suffer, to be alone, to push everyone away and be stuck. i have my boyfriend, loving friends, great teachers and support systems, meds, therapy, my mom, access to everything i could ever want and its still not enough. i could have the world and i think i would still he broken. i just want to be held. comforted, held by my dad just one last time. just one second off affection. i could die like that i think. i don't know if i want to wake up tomorrow. its been a lot.

1jmc0lh,2025-03-29T03:09:30,"I want to quit therapy and die instead
As I get attached to my T I‚Äôve been projecting all sorts on her but lately it took a turn where while I was struggling without her I started cherry picking and collating all the things that could be a ‚Äúsign‚Äù she is avoiding me and having some ulterior motive behind why she‚Äôs still keeping me as a client. I was worried this was true and felt really lonely and pathetic, and thought I‚Äôd better reject her before she rejects me, so I started writing an email laying out all my ‚Äúobservations‚Äù around how she faced about with appt times and stuff and how I ‚Äúknew‚Äù what she was doing even if it was unintentional on her part and she was trying hard to tolerate me, and I even wrote ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not stupid‚Äù, and suggested she could be holding onto me for money.

Thankfully I didn‚Äôt send it. What stopped me was coming across a starkly different perspective online on what therapists‚Äô lives can be like and I broke down realising what a piece of shit human I am for thinking this would be a good idea to send to someone who‚Äôs been so great to me.

Anyway I spiralled and started feeling suicidal. Since then I‚Äôve been feeling on edge, agitated, more depressed than ever and can‚Äôt stop thinking about the best way to die. And this all reminds me of a few years ago when this happened after some things I noticed suggested people were watching me and keeping tabs on me, and it escalated into thinking that even strangers were ‚Äúin on it‚Äù and that the police wouldn‚Äôt do anything about all this ‚Äòinvasion on my privacy‚Äô because they were ‚Äúprobably in on it too‚Äù, and it made me feel so distressed, trapped and hopeless that I nearly drank toxic chemicals (t doesn‚Äôt know any this)

And I feel like that again, but it‚Äôs on and off and while I don‚Äôt have those thoughts about my T, sometimes I have hints of ‚Äú‚Ä¶but could it be true?‚Äù but most of the time I just hate myself for having nearly sent that email. It actually disturbs me now. The fact that I considered it at all makes me feel like I should leave my T because I don‚Äôt deserve help if I‚Äôm going to act like a mean and evil human. If I told her about it she would probably draw the line there anyway and terminate me herself, right?

Even if that isn‚Äôt to enough to make her want to end our sessions, I‚Äôm worried she‚Äôd still end them bc maybe she doesn‚Äôt have enough experience in that area.

1jmc4w1,2025-03-29T03:15:54,"Help
What do you do when you‚Äôre alone with no one to talk to? You talk to yourself. And I‚Äôve been so alone that my own voice became a knife in the silence that surrounded me. It felt foreign and sharp in contrast to the empty space I constantly occupied. So instead of talking to myself, I write online, typing thoughts like confessions into the void in the hopes that someone, anyone, might echo back something other than the pain Im trying to exorcise from myself.

Depression doesn‚Äôt always look like pale skin, dark circles, and messy hair. Sometimes, it looks like a perfectly normal girl sitting  in her living room, doing everything she can to seem fine. I‚Äôll never forget the stranger who came to my apartment one night. It was supposed to be a date, but I canceled in the most honest way I could because I was simply, utterly exhausted from hiding that I was not okay. I hadn‚Äôt been okay for a long time, and I couldn‚Äôt pretend I was anymore . I told him I was struggling with thoughts of suicide and couldn‚Äôt bring myself to leave my apartment.  he asked if he could still come over‚Äîif I would still have him. I remember staring at that message, thinking maybe he hadn‚Äôt actually read mine, or at least not all of it. So I asked again, plainly‚Äîdid you see what I said? Did you see what I said? That I‚Äôm not okay. That I‚Äôm struggling to stay alive today. He hadn‚Äôt. He missed the part where I confessed the weight I‚Äôd been carrying. When he finally read it, I told him that I wouldn‚Äôt hold it against him if he chose not to come. And I had meant it I know people feel pressure in these moments‚Äîthere‚Äôs a sense of panic, of moral responsibility. Most people don‚Äôt want someone to end their life, but they also don‚Äôt know what to say or how to be in the room with that kind of truth. And honestly, I‚Äôm glad some people don‚Äôt understand. Even if it‚Äôs why people like me are often judged or dismissed or met with awkward silence‚Äîit means they haven‚Äôt had to carry this weight. And I wouldn‚Äôt wish it on anyone. This isn‚Äôt romantic. It‚Äôs not poetic. It‚Äôs not  martyrdom , or some glamorous kind of sadness. It‚Äôs a slow rot. It‚Äôs something that gnaws at the foundation of you until your body remains but you‚Äôre no longer inside it. It‚Äôs destructive. And when he said he still wanted to come over, I let him. I didn‚Äôt clean up or change. I stayed in the same clothes I‚Äôd been wearing. When I opened the door, I tried to keep my face neutral, blank not for me, but for him. I didn‚Äôt want to make him uncomfortable. I was numb. My body was tired. My spirit felt worn through. The apartment was dim, too quiet, too still like a tomb. I had moved my life into the living room because the bedroom felt like it was swallowing me whole. There was no clutter, just a hollowed-out kind of order‚Äîessentials and nothing more. When he looked at me, the first thing he said was, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt look like someone struggling with wanting to die.‚Äù And something in me flinched. I didn‚Äôt know what I had expected, but it wasn‚Äôt that. For a second I wondered, Is that what people think? When they see me? When they see anyone? What does someone look like when they‚Äôre collapsing inside? I looked him in the eye and asked, ‚ÄúIs there some way you have to look to feel that way?‚Äù Depression doesn‚Äôt wear a uniform. It doesn‚Äôt always show up in ways you can see. Sometimes it looks like chaos. Sometimes it looks like disintegration. And sometimes it looks just like i did that night standing blank-faced at the door, breathing through dying on the inside while trying not to make it weird for the guy standing on the welcome mat.
At the lowest points of my depression, it‚Äôs wild to me that it was when  I received the most compliments on my appearance. I was the thinnest I had ever been, and that includes the times when I was deep in active eating disorders and drug abuse. I went from 210 pounds down to 120 in four months. I‚Äôd look at myself in the mirror and i could no longer  recognize the hollowed-out person looking back at me.  My body matched what i felt like inside, like I was shrinking out of my life. People smiled at me like wasting away was an accomplishment I was now achieving . No one saw the  screaming that the change really was . they just saw someone who had been overweight becoming skinny. And that was ‚Äúa good thing.‚Äù I was praised for silently drowning. 

I understand how helpless it feels to care about someone who‚Äôs suicidal. You want to help. You want to take their pain away. But you can‚Äôt. I know that powerlessness. But I also know what it‚Äôs like to be on the other side, to be silently pleading for someone to see me. To not tell me my feelings are wrong. To not tell me I‚Äôm overreacting. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel loved,‚Äù and people have rushed to say, ‚ÄúBut you are loved,‚Äù ‚ÄúThere are people who love you,‚Äù as if my suffering was something I choose to feel As if I were being dramatic. Ungrateful. Blind to what‚Äôs right in front of me.

I‚Äôve stood in both places. And I still can‚Äôt tell you definitively what the right way to be is. But what  I can say is: sometimes the right thing isn‚Äôt a thing at all. It‚Äôs simply presence. just‚Ä¶ someone actively being there. 

I get that many people don‚Äôt know how to sit with me in my pain. But God‚Ä¶ I wonder do they ever step outside their own skin even for a moment, to wonder what it‚Äôs like for me to live in it? I can‚Äôt escape it. I can‚Äôt soothe it. It doesn‚Äôt stay stuffed away. It‚Äôs always there, persistent, aching, taking the coloring from everything. No one can see it. And that‚Äôs its own kind of pain. Because I feel it‚Ä¶ but their criticisms of how I react to what they think just doesn‚Äôt exist makes me question if I‚Äôm even really feeling it at all. Until I begin to gaslight myself
I can‚Äôt describe to you the tragedy of experiencing so much humanity within myself, and yet being convinced I‚Äôm fabricating it. Like it‚Äôs if I‚Äôm stabbing myself and crying for help, but everyone‚Äôs too busy pointing out that the knife is in my hand to notice that I‚Äôm bleeding out.

I know everyone has something going on that no one else knows about. We‚Äôre all stumbling through this life for the first time. And none of us really knows what we‚Äôre doing here. Sometimes, that thought comforts me. It softens the sting when people let me down. Other times, it makes me feel completely bleak and nihilistic. Because I know, no one is coming to save me. And no matter how hard I try, I can‚Äôt seem to save myself.

I don‚Äôt blame anyone.

Hi, I‚Äôm new here. I searched for a sub like this because I am unwell and need a little support. 

Quick back story: raised by a narcissistic/borderline mother and an untreated bipolar father.  My brother died by suicide seven years ago. I have a lifelong history of mental illness and SI and probably have C-ptsd anxiety and MDD. Been through every med and type of therapy imaginable and sometimes I have good results at first but without fail, I always end up back at square one. 
I have had real issues with emotion regulation and have left a wake hurt in my path. My husband has divorced me and I think this might just be the straw that breaks my back. 
I have literally spent my life trying to just be okay. I have finally realized that I am unable to be helped. No amount of meds or therapy or meditation is going to help me enough to make a difference in my relationships and reactivity. It won‚Äôt bring my husband back to me. 
I‚Äôm just exhausted and can‚Äôt do this for 40 or so more years. I don‚Äôt want to do it anymore at all. I have kids and grandkids who I love deeply and who are the reason I‚Äôm still here. I fear the day they won‚Äôt be enough to hold me here. With my brother dying of suicide, I‚Äôve seen firsthand the damage it leaves behind and I am determined not to put that on my kids and grands. 
All that said, ending it is so heavy on my mind. Tonight I kinda looked around the closet for a belt or scarf in case I wanted it. Just to see if there was something I could use. 
My therapy appointment is April 1 and right now my whole goal is to last that long.

1jma9p9,2025-03-29T01:39:50,"Once I sort out everything for my family, I will be gone
Hello,

I'd appreciate it if you read this.

I'm 20, male, from England.

I've been on anti-depressants and had therapy for years (quit therapy about a year ago because it was only doing worse).

I have ups and downs. On my ""ups"", I know I still don't want to be here, but I don't have the confidence to do anything. Right now I'm on a ""down"" and I think I'm ready to do it.

I can't tell you what's wrong - I wish I knew. I lived with my mildly abusive mother for about 6 years, but I don't believe that contributes to this. Recently, I think loneliness has just been killing me, I really feel like I need somebody to love. Though, even while I had a girlfriend, I still had these feelings. Maybe it's just meant to be?

Talking of ""meant to be"", I'm agnostic but three nights ago I prayed. I just wanted anything. I asked for a sign that something is out there caring for me, anything which wants me to live. I don't believe I had any sign.

I'm planning on being gone by tomorrow or Sunday. I have a list of the things which needs done by then.

- Write notes for the people I care most about; my father, my sister, my ex (we're still very close), my very close internet friend, my mother, my job (we're an SME and I'm hoping the shock of a suicide will show them that the signs of depression really aren't noticeable - I basically just want them to know I commit suicide, no details), and my best friend - my dog.

- Tidy up my possessions. I still live with my father and I'm hiding vapes and two 3D printed dildos from him, really don't want him to discover that after my death.

- I own a server with my sisters and brother-in-laws contents on it. I will make sure they have those.

- General House tidy. I have some clothes to wash and guitars hanging around. I want to make sure everything is clean and no chores required for my father.

My father is incredibly sensitive. He's near to crying upon the mention of a funeral, so it's so difficult to do this to him. I was initially thinking of inhaling an inert gas such as nitrogen, though I'm worried about releasing the gas into the house. And most notably, I don't want my father to discover my body.

I've tried choking myself to see if I would have the confidence to kill myself, and I have managed to make myself pass out a few times. Therefore, I think that is the method I will use.

I think I've typed enough for now, but I'm completely open for suggestions and questions (honestly happy if my life is a case study, feel free to ask about my life and feelings - nothing is disrespectful).

Notably, I think I've heard every suggestion/advice there is. Thank you for anything you may say, but I don't think it's necessary.

Much love to you and the world.",sort everything family gone hello id appreciate read im 20 male england ive antidepressants therapy years quit therapy year ago worse ups downs ups know still dont want dont confidence anything right im think im ready cant tell whats wrong wish knew lived mildly abusive mother 6 years dont believe contributes recently think loneliness killing really feel like need somebody love though even girlfriend still feelings maybe meant talking meant im agnostic three nights ago prayed wanted anything asked sign something caring anything wants live dont believe sign im planning gone tomorrow sunday list things needs done write notes people care father sister ex still close close internet friend mother job sme im hoping shock suicide show signs depression really arent noticeable basically want know commit suicide details best friend dog tidy possessions still live father im hiding vapes two 3d printed dildos really dont want discover death server sisters brotherinlaws contents make sure general house tidy clothes wash guitars hanging around want make sure everything clean chores required father father incredibly sensitive hes near crying upon mention funeral difficult initially thinking inhaling inert gas nitrogen though im worried releasing gas house notably dont want father discover body ive tried choking see would confidence kill managed make pass times therefore think method use think ive typed enough im completely open suggestions questions honestly happy life case study feel free ask life feelings nothing disrespectful notably think ive heard every suggestionadvice thank anything may say dont think necessary much love world,1,0,0,Positive,Low,[],[]

1jm9ven,2025-03-29T01:19:40,"I‚Äôm just a failure.

This semester was supposed to be the semester that I‚Äôd do better. I was doing *so* well. I woke up and went to bed on a decent schedule, I was keeping up with my homework. And..it just came crashing down on me. And really- there‚Äôs no excuse for it. I thought I was doing somewhat better, until my professor talked to me about an exam I absolutely bombed. I understood *why*- I didn‚Äôt even fill out all of the questions, and what I did attempt was so wrong he felt awful attempting to grade it.

He then advised me that if I‚Äôm unable to perform well on the next exam, my best bet would be either failing the course (and retaking it for a third time) or withdrawing from it. I don‚Äôt know why, but it broke something in me. I finally looked inside myself and admitted:

College was never the right choice for me. I don‚Äôt have the intelligence to succeed. I shouldn‚Äôt have gotten the idea that I could be something more than a dishwasher for the rest of my life.

I‚Äôd been having that realization in the back of my mind ever since I began university, and having that line of thought finally confirmed‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know. I had a panic attack so bad I could barely breathe. Really‚Äî it‚Äôs no one‚Äôs fault but my own. ADHD, Autism, PTSD, and all of the other conditions I struggle with make university life hard, but I still try my best.

But sometimes your best isn‚Äôt enough, and that‚Äôs okay. But honestly? I‚Äôm tired of trying. Twenty three thousand dollars and 3 1/2 years of my life I‚Äôll never get back. Encouragement from my friends, both back at home and online, from my family members. Money spent on school supplies, blankets and pillows or other stuff for my dorm.

It all amounted to nothing. At this rate, I‚Äôll be in undergrad until I am 24. I don‚Äôt know why I tried so hard to prove that someone like me, a woman from extreme poverty and abuse, could come out stronger than what she was born into. I wish I would‚Äôve listened to my mother when she called me the r-slur and told me I‚Äôd amount to nothing. I should‚Äôve listened to when an old friend of mine told me I was weak, and that my dreams were a low bar.

Ultimately, I‚Äôm tired. A deep, visceral tiredness. I‚Äôm ready to throw in the towel. I‚Äôm going to clean up my room tomorrow so it‚Äôs not a hassle to be cleared by police. I‚Äôm going to wipe my phone and my laptop. I‚Äôve already taken down my social media. I don‚Äôt wish to be remembered, nor do I deserve to be mourned. 

If my parting words can mean anything:

Please. Don‚Äôt be afraid to get the help that you need. Even if you do it scared, you‚Äôre still doing it. Don‚Äôt be like me and wait until it‚Äôs too late.

I‚Äôm 22. On track to graduate this December with a degree in Anthropology, and minors in biology and forensic sciences. I‚Äôm being honored at an award ceremony April 9th, which is also my partners birthday.

The whole world has always been ahead of me. My future has been bright. I have a stable, solid, beautiful life. I‚Äôve never been happy to live on. 

I‚Äôve been passively suicidal for the past 8 years, and was actively suicidal the 2 years prior to those. On 9/27/15 my mom found out that my dad was cheating on her, and I overheard everything. I‚Äôve never been the same after that. Even though I‚Äôve forgiven my father, my parents are still together, and my brother knows nothing of the sort.

I‚Äôve been in this terrifying cycle of putting myself in dangerous situations, being hurt and abused by the people I put so much trust into, and I know it‚Äôs all a part of life. I beat anorexia, I beat a self harm addiction, and I‚Äôve beat so much more. But this empty pit inside of me is one I could never get rid of. 

I‚Äôve gotten hobbies, became an outstanding student, started pushing past all the depressive weight. All I found was that underneath it all, I still don‚Äôt feel right. I have it all. I always have. I‚Äôm just the problem. I have amazing friends, a supportive family, and so much else.

It gets harder and harder to live for other people. I don‚Äôt know if they can see through me or not, but I‚Äôve been ready. For the past 4 years since I‚Äôve left my parents house, I‚Äôve been planning who I‚Äôll give what to, trying to buy less stuff for everyone to clean up when I leave, making sure that everybody has what they need before I go. 

I just feel myself getting weaker. Today my pet mouse died. That was the one loose end I couldn‚Äôt tie up if I left. I don‚Äôt know anybody who could‚Äôve taken care of him in my absence. 

My partner is out of the house for the weekend. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about packing up my stuff into labeled boxes and writing my letters. The thing that keeps me here is that I wouldn‚Äôt want to traumatize anybody with finding me. I watched a man jump in front of a train about a decade or so ago. Watching him be cleaned up, remembering his face before, it‚Äôs never left me. Years after that when I was 17 my best friends neighbor killed himself. I watched his wife scream in their backyard on her hands and knees in the rain. I saw her pain for what it was. It filled me with guilt that I‚Äôd ever want to do that to someone else.

The pressure building inside me to do something is deafening. I‚Äôm 22. My life is great. I just can‚Äôt enjoy it. I‚Äôve tried so much to get past this. I just can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm planning to be done getting my things in order in mid May at the end of my semester. 

I‚Äôm ready now, as I‚Äôve been for 10 years. I‚Äôve tried everything I can think of. What can I do? What can I do to soften the blow? What can I try that I haven‚Äôt tried? What should I see that I haven‚Äôt seen?

Had a breakup about 6 months ago,  not able to move on, she was my everything. Always loved her, she always loved me too. She was my world, we would talk anything to everything, I wouldn't hide anything for her, I was that comfortable with my love. I think she also never hid anything from me, I mean she told me how she started to have feelings for someone else too (girl) while she also loved me, I think this tells what level of comfort we had towards each other, some complicated situations happened, now she is with that other person she started having feelings.

I sacrificed myself for her gf, and had to tell her I didn't love her, or else she wouldn't have left me. Her gf was near suicidal because her ex commited suicide, and she started to hate me. My gf had to lie to be able to talk to me.

I personally didn't like that, thought about this in the future, realised how devasting this would be if she keeps on lying and eventually her gf gets to know about this. I mean at some point she has to know. Decided to show her through actions that I didn't care. I noticed how much I had to change myself to interpret that. She asked me always, I said yes I did love her. But never showed it back through actions.

Last day, she asked me if I loved her. I kept silent interpreting that I didn't. She left

Now she is happier than ever before with her gf.

 Im having suicidal thoughts now, on one side I think about how I fixed things, I admit I had to do it in a path in which I hurted her a lot, but I didn't know what to do at the point, her gf wouldn't talk to me or something. She hated me. My ex told me how she doesn't have feelings for me anymore and that she can't see me as a lover again. I think it's cause of her gf she tells me that, she doesn't wanna be with me and her gf now that ik not there, which is perfectly fine. I do feel a bit betrayed here

But I always loved her, it hurts a lot upto a point, I have literally heart ache and breathing problems every night. I'm living off of the hope, she might breakup with her gf someday and maybe give me a chance, I would want her to give me a chance if that happens.
But on the other side I don't want them to breakup, cause that would be really hurtful for he'd, she'd be all alone. I'm scared for her if she falls into that situation, i sacrificed my lovers happiness and future and ended up hurting myself

To all the people telling I'm dumb, I know I am, can you please help me feel bad about myself.

I can't find a job because my parents took me out of high school two years before graduation. No job means going back to my parents  because I can't pay rent. For some context one of my parents strangled me as a child. I was thrown over furniture. Shown movies that were 18+ when I was only 12. Shown videos of people getting electrocuted to death. Was called a brat when I cried and didn't want to see the videos. My other parent would touch me in ways that made me uncomfortable.

 I bathed in brown water because the drain was clogged. There were slugs, spiders, flies, and dead centipedes floating in the tub with me. My parents didn't clean and said it was my fault the house was dirty. Mice would shit and piss on my toys. ( I had to clean it off myslef. )  I also slept on the floor for like a year while my siblings got beds. The carpet was itchy and I only had two knitted blankets. One I used for under me. I was fucking cold.  My father would step over me while going to work instead of using the back door. I didn't sleep well.

 I've been touched as a child by multiple adults of both genders. I became hypersexual to cope and have a porn addiction. I also suffer from psychosis which got bad at 16. I see things that aren't there. I haven't been diagnosed with anything yet because seeing the doctor for that is about $2,000 without insurance.  I do see a psychiatrist and a occupational therapist. They told me to inform them if I think about ending it all. I'm thinking about taking all the pills in the house then making myself I little blanket nest in my apartment bathtub. One problem though, My sister lives with me and I don't want her to find my body or try to stop me. Deep down I don't want to die. I just want to be free of these people. (not my sister tho)

I visited my parents last weekend because I am stupid.  Everyone was playing happy family until the end where I got kissed on the neck and had to smile through it all because who knows what will happen if I make a scene.

1jm4t25,2025-03-28T21:29:32,"Dating Apps Are Making Me Want To End It
The title is a bit of an oversimplification, but overall it's still the case.

A little over a year ago I was in a relationship with a girlfriend I loved quite a lot. But the relationship ended extremely suddenly and pretty much out of nowhere. I really haven't been able to process it even over a year later, honestly. It still hurts so much every day. That alone often makes me want to end it.

But then on top of that I've been on a dating app for about a year now. I haven't used it completely consistently in that time, but still quite a bit. And I'm still single after an entire year of trying. This is having two effects on me.

The first is that it is making me feel extremely insecure about my appearance. I already have body dysmorphic disorder, so I already have quite a lot of emotional and complex feelings about how I look. And then being on a dating site like this on top of that and basically feeling constantly rejected is making me feel utterly disgusting quite a lot of the time. Which is destroying what little remained of my self-esteem. And that is also making me want to end it.

And then secondly, it is making me feel a combination of frustrated and hopeless.

Frustrated, because I want a relationship again and all of the things that are part of it. And I also very much need sex and that has also been freaking torture not having that for over a year. It is driving me mad all on its own, on top of not having a girlfriend to talk to, hug, kiss, go out with, build a life with, etc.

Hopeless because it has been like a year now. And I'm really seriously starting to feel trapped and like I'll never find someone again.

For the record, I also have social anxiety and am quite isolated so meeting someone without an app is extremely unlikely for me, even if I could (which, at this point I'm insecure enough that I'm not sure I could even in that case, maybe I'm just that repulsive and awful).

And that hopelessness is the final thing that is making me just want to give up on life.

And then it's not like I have a great life other than that. Other than that my life is messed up and empty and I suffer from depression as well.

So my life is in ruins, I suffer from severe depression, sometimes it hurts so much what happened with my previous girlfriend that the only way I can make it hurt less is through self-harm and it makes me want to die immediately, then on top of that I feel disgusting because of being on the dating app, frustrated and utterly hopeless that I'll find anyone again ever because I'm starting to feel like such a disgusting awful person that nobody wants me.

It's getting to be too much for me.

I want the pain to end. I want the misery to end. I want to feel something positive. And I've pretty much lost hope that I can at this point in any way other than offing myself.

There are just so many reasons to end it (even more than I mentioned here) that it has become ridiculous not to. I know that rationally, but I continuously find it hard to accept emotionally. I didn't want my life to be this way, I didn't want it to end this way, I want to believe that there is some hope, even though there probably isn't.

And being on these dating apps makes me feel so disgusting, frustrated, worthless and hopeless. But I have no other way to even try to find someone else. So I keep having to use them and I feel just completely awful every time I do.

I'm writing this in no small part because I just finished swiping on one of them.

My teeth have been hurting for years. Last time at the dentist was apparently 5 years ago. I had some terrible days/weeks in that time and knew everything was just getting worse in there but the pain was never as bad as now. Today I crumbled and decided to go after writhing and silently crying from pain not being able to sleep or eat for just around 3 days now, i think? Im pretty sure i overdosed on ibuprofen too, it hurt and still hurts so bad. I want to just fucking end it so much more than usual.

I shouldnt have went at all. The dentist was so disappointed, her tone completely different from the one she used when talking to the previous patient. She had to keep reminding me to open my mouth because it was so embarassing, i closed it every time she turned away. Within the first few seconds she started listing all the things wrong with my teeth, noting that probably half of them need some kind of treatment. Saying that its very unusual to see people have such terrible teeth at my age.

Then she proceeded to do im honestly not fucking sure what with the teeth that hurt like a bitch, but there was so much blood. No anesthesia, though it honestly could be worse. It hurt but not too badly, since apparently its already pretty much dead. I still flinched many times when she touched the wrong spot with those hellish fucking tools. I think she poisoned/devitalized the tooth(?) as it still hurts, but a bit differently than before. She wants to start a root canal treatment in that tooth in two weeks.

When the dentist was done, her assistant(?) randomly told me something along the lines of ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt handle all this alone‚Äù and i know shes right, i cant, i cant handle anything at all. I cant handle a mild toothache, i cant handle living. It was so out of the blue. I almost started fucking crying right there because how does she know. Because of the listing of all the bad teeth, cementing the truth of how im so much worse and behind than everyone else in every way. Of the disappointment because what normal person lets their teeth get to that point at all. Because of everything.

Later, at home, my mother also scolded me for not telling her it hurts sooner and not wanting to go. She was so disappointed for letting myself get to this state. where i cant just suck it up and fucking bear with it like i do every other time something hurts. Im so regretful that i told her and we went, that she and the dentist found out just how gross i am and that im in pain.

I had a girlfriend, Mila, whose parents divorced when we were kids. Her father moved to London with her twin sister, Lila, while Mila stayed in Germany with her mother. I‚Äôd always had a crush on Lila, but we lost contact after she moved.

Before turning sixteen, I snuck out of my dad's house at 10pm, met up with friends, and went to a party where I drank vodka, s¬£x on the beach, had Red Bull, and took lighter dr#gs like c0caine and c\*ack. That night left me feeling bummed, and I ended up hooking up with Mila. We started dating, but neither of us was in a good place‚ÄîI'm self-destructive with a complex PTSD diagnosis and heavy chronic depression, and I spent the last two months in a mental asylum without a home after being kicked out of my residential group.

I also have Hyperthyroidism, which speeds up metabolism and can cause weight loss, hand tremors, and rapid or irregular heartbeat. In rare cases, it can be fatal. I was close to death until doctors acted quickly after an alarming blood test.

Back to the relationship: Mila was controlling and often used her mental illness as an excuse. She has PTSD and a Narcissistic Disorder, frequently degrading me by calling me a sl&t and wh0re, and forcing me to have s¬£x with her. There were times she‚Äôd hit me or c#t me with a kn!fe‚Äîthough I also self-harm regularly, so I guess it wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal.

A few weeks ago, her sister Lila returned to the city, and though Mila and Lila developed a close relationship, there was something between Lila and me that made me feel happy. I‚Äôd had a childhood crush on Lila, and despite our similarities, the small differences between her and Mila made my heart flutter. One day, while Mila was out shopping, Lila and I ended up flirting and eventually landed in bed. I felt a bit of remorse, but nothing major happened the next time we were alone‚Äîuntil we couldn‚Äôt keep our hands off each other again. It was inevitable that Mila would find out, yet I couldn‚Äôt break up with her. Maybe it was wrong, but Lila is... I can‚Äôt really describe it.

Eventually, Mila walked in on us cuddling with Lila n@ked and threw a hysterical fit. The police had to come and restrain her. I never meant to hurt her, but Lila comforted me, appreciated me, loved me, and gave me self-confidence. She motivated me to stop taking drugs and quit drinking. I just really love her.

He gaslights me intensely and puts me down.

He does this especially when I tell him something he did hurts me. There is no way to discuss an issue without it becoming a fight. And he always makes me question my sanity or memory. It gives me such severe anxiety, over time worse and worse.

When he does this, I beg him to stop because it hurts but he won't. 

He doesn't take personal accountability for anything at all. He tells me if I don't like it, I can leave. He says he can't change his whole personality for me.

I'm selfish i know. I'm so sorry to all the people i've hurt and will hurt. I'm trying to keep it together in front of my family and friends because I don't want to hurt them. I know ive got so much to live for and ill be able to achieve great things. Trust me, I know and I recognise that. I'm not gonna say it's freeing, but I just want closure. I want to stop, not to keep going on.

I'm laughing and smiling around people, i'm happy, i'm making jokes. I want to keep trying. But i can't. I'm obliged to keep living and its selfish to let go. Theres so many people around me who make life worth living and i'm letting all of them down. 

The feeling comes in waves. One moment i'm feeling fine and the next it's like my heart stopped. My body's functioning but my mind's somewhere else. The lump in my throat makes it hard to breathe. My mom asked me what I wanted for breakfast and I couldn't even answer her. 

I told my brother a lot of what was going on (excluding the suicidal parts) and he listened to all of it. I'm so thankful for a brother like him. He doesn't understand cause he's so young. I'm not gonna bother him with my problems. I hope he will have the best life, I love him so much.

Thank you to my parents, who've raised me for so many years. We might've had our differences but deep down I'm grateful to have met them, and will love them till the end of time. Thank you to all my friends, they've shaped me to become who I am today, and I love them all so much. I've had so many happy memories which i'll treasure.

I'm a mosaic of every family and friend I've met, and a part of them will forever be with me. For that I love myself as i'm a reflection of everyone i've loved.

I'm not blaming anyone. I'm so thankful for all the people ive got to know, good or bad. It's no one's fault, not my family, my friends, people around me, people who dislike me, or even God. It's just how life played out and i know im gonna hurt so many people and its incredibly selfish of me to do it. For that i'll never be able to forgive myselt. Believe me, I'm grateful to have lived a good life, and I'm grateful for having had a chance to live. 

This isn't a post for people to stop me in the comments. Please don't feel bad or sad for me, i don't feel sad nor do I blame anyone. It's not the world's fault, there is no fault. I'm posting this just to leave footprints here. I don't need condolences or well wishes, I don't need a listening ear, I don't need advice. I'm at peace with what will happen.

Thank you God, thank you to everyone I've known, thank you life. I'm sorry in advance if reading this affected ur mood, that wasn't my intention, but thank you all for reading. Hoping you'll live great lives and accomplish amazing things. Much love.

1jm1qir,2025-03-28T19:19:04,"consciousness is a curse and i want to end it
i hate being alive i feel like nobody actually wants to be with me i have friends and family but i always feel like the last choice. right now my friendgroup is hanging out without me (like they always do). my best friend and i were supposed to hang out tonight but as usual she cancelled on me and is hanging out with her other friends. some might say that they‚Äôre all just bad friends but i don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre the problem because it always seems to be that i‚Äôm the last choice. every friend i‚Äôve ever had has been like this. 

i‚Äôve always felt like an outsider with my parents and my brother. they all like the same things and are all so academic. i have very bad dyslexia and know nothing about what they always talk about. even when we‚Äôre celebrating my birthday they talk about stuff i cant talk about. i think it‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt want me there and don‚Äôt like me, i think they would prefer if the family was only them 3 and not me. they mostly just ignore me or get mad at me because they think i‚Äôm lazy, i think i‚Äôm just depressed and that‚Äôs why i act the way i act. 

i‚Äôve seen different therapists since i was maybe 10 because of anxiety attacks and other stuff but i stopped going at 15-16 and i‚Äôm pretending i don‚Äôt feel like that anymore. but in reality i feel much worse. and nobody knows it.

i feel as if nothing is real like seriously nothing makes sense and being conscious feels so wrong and it makes me freak out and feel sick. like how am i typing this? how do i have fingers and how do i see and hear? how did i even get here? how was i at school today and now i‚Äôm at home? nothing makes sense or feels real. i feel numb or sad when i‚Äôm alone and i can never turn of my inner monologue. it‚Äôs always some voice in my head and it‚Äôs annoying. it doesn‚Äôt say scary or bad things but it‚Äôs just there and i cant get rid of it.

if i could find a way to do it without overwhelming pain i would do it. another priority is that i don‚Äôt end up alive but like blind or imobile or something because that would make everything worse. i don‚Äôt really care what happens after or if someone turns out to actually be sad because i won‚Äôt know about it because i‚Äôll be dead and not have the curse of consciousness anymore, so don‚Äôt try to convince me to not do it because someone will be sad about it. i also don‚Äôt think they will be sad about it. 

idk why i ended up like this, my family members and other relatives don‚Äôt have any disorders and they all just click. i‚Äôve tried to hang out with all sorts of people but no one seems to actually genuinely like me.

that‚Äôs it i just wanted someone to know",consciousness curse want end hate alive feel like nobody actually wants friends family always feel like last choice right friendgroup hanging without like always best friend supposed hang tonight usual cancelled hanging friends might say theyre bad friends dont think theyre problem always seems im last choice every friend ive ever like ive always felt like outsider parents brother like things academic bad dyslexia know nothing always talk even celebrating birthday talk stuff cant talk think dont want dont like think would prefer family 3 mostly ignore get mad think im lazy think im depressed thats act way act ive seen different therapists since maybe 10 anxiety attacks stuff stopped going 1516 im pretending dont feel like anymore reality feel much worse nobody knows feel nothing real like seriously nothing makes sense conscious feels wrong makes freak feel sick like typing fingers see hear even get school today im home nothing makes sense feels real feel numb sad im alone never turn inner monologue always voice head annoying doesnt say scary bad things cant get rid could find way without overwhelming pain would another priority dont end alive like blind imobile something would make everything worse dont really care happens someone turns actually sad wont know ill dead curse consciousness anymore dont try convince someone sad also dont think sad idk ended like family members relatives dont disorders click ive tried hang sorts people one seems actually genuinely like thats wanted someone know,2,0,0,Negative,High,[],[]
1jm1ep3,2025-03-28T19:05:07,"Privileged and useless
Hi, im 22 and male. Born in the US and was lucky enough to have caring parents who paid for my university tuition. I graduated with a BS in Finance and a minor in Business Analytics at a good university.. but I am useless.

Its been 11 months since ive graduated and while i have dreams to travel, I have no job. I‚Äôve forgotten all of the skills and knowledge I learned. I‚Äôve been rejected in interviews and my parents rightfully have a i-told-you-so attitude telling me I should‚Äôve gotten myself out there earlier. I took no internship so I have no experience. I have only worked a warehouse job which is useless in terms of skills. If I go back there again I will be made fun of for not having a real job.

Im in a LDR and have someone I want to visit in the future but if im being honest I think im kinda done for.. I love them but I lost all of my drive seeing an interview rejection email this morning. 

I have everything friends from a third world country want. I live in a nice house, a warm bed, a kind family, in the US.. but I‚Äôve done nothing in my life to deserve it and am unable to repay my parents. I‚Äôve wasted their money and now have a useless degree and just wish someone else was born in my place. I spend a lot of time now playing some games, sleeping, and just rotting away. 

I was given everything yet I have zero confidence, no communication skills, no talent, no real world knowledge/experience, and last but not least.. no more drive to try. 

I‚Äôve talked to friends for advice but never follow through on what they suggest because im a stubborn idiot. There is a dam near my house with a bridge to jump from and I‚Äôve thought about it many times while biking there. Im sure if I sat on the ledge someone would give me the final push I need to end it. 

I really can‚Äôt be helped. I won‚Äôt listen to advice and never try to better myself even though I know I need it. Then I blame myself for being useless and cry a river to start my morning depressed. I‚Äôve let everyone I know down and I have no ability to get a job that I am supposed to be specialized in. Everyone I knew around my age has moved on and are successful in their life.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still young, you have time..‚Äù
‚ÄúI believe in you, you got this‚Äù
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt give up‚Äù
‚Ä¶
I‚Äôve heard it a million times and wish these things helped but they don‚Äôt when I am not determined to do anything.. not that I would even be able to.

Im just repeating myself at this point but its okay. 

Whether you read it all or skipped my post, thank you. I needed somewhere to vent anonymously. Its a difficult world for someone with a will as weak as mine. As generic as it sounds I really think there is no place for me in this world. 

I love my family
I love my significant other
I love my friends

But I don‚Äôt serve any purpose being around today and I know it would be easier on them if I wasn‚Äôt around.

1jm1979,2025-03-28T18:59:03,"I don't know how to keep going
I don't know how much longer I can keep doing this, I don't want to keep doing this. I don't want to live, I'm tired. 

I can't count the number of times I've woken up and my first thoughts are of ending things. I want peace, I want freedom, I want to stop feeling shitty all the time, I want to experience life as a better, more valuable man. I struggle to believe that's possible for me, I feel too far gone, too wrong, like life wasn't meant for me. 

I don't know why I never went to college, maybe I was too lazy, or too far gone with mental health. I was still able to get an okay job, with benefits and an average wage. Despite that, my upward mobility is likely non-existent, I'm going to be this forever, I'm never going to be impressive the way I would need to be to live the life I envision. I work with taxes, and regular see people paying more with a single cheque than I've ever accumulated over the course of my entire life, it's crushing. I failed financially. 

Not that my job is going to do me much good if the world implodes. Things just seem to get worse, life is unaffordable, populations are getting dumber and more violent and more hateful, social cohesion is dissolving, new wars are starting, the environment is screwed, scientists have noticed an asteroid. I failed to be lucky, to be born in a better time and place. 

I struggle socially. I have a few good friends, and I see them semi-regularly, but I'll lose them eventually and I doubt my ability to make new ones; I certainly don't have the energy or mental bandwidth. I've never been in a relationship, and as uncomfortable as it is to admit, sex is a big problem. I spent my childhood religious, learning to be deeply uncomfortable with the idea of intimacy done ""incorrectly"", and now that I've deconstructed I realize that it was never going to work for me anyway. I'm not attractive, not tall, not fit, not funny, not charismatic, not rich, not anything -

- What I am is a hypocrite, being attracted to and desperately wanting experiences with women who I find exceptionally attractive while I look the way I do, without the ability to offer any kind of attractiveness in return. Please don't misunderstand, I'm not a misogynist, I don't think I'm entitled to it. I dislike and vehemently disagree with incels; they spread and perpetuate wrong and harmful rhetoric. Unfortunately the term applies to me, definitionally. If I end up leaving life behind, I hope people don't remember me as being lumped in with them. I failed to be the person I wanted to be. 

I don't know why I'm posting this, I don't know what I want out of it. I guess if nothing else, I wanted to vent. I don't believe there's anything that can help me, not in a meaningful way, to hope for that would be hoping for the impossible. ""The universe is, and we are"". It's just not a universe made for me, and I want to leave it.

1jm0cgm,2025-03-28T18:20:32,"Too many times have I been pushed to severe depression again despite trying so damn hard. I want to fucking curly throat open like what wa supposed to happen
(Context: I was a foreign student) Okay well basically I (19M) was getting panic attacks everyday in the UK from September to December, due to a bunch of trauma related to education when I got severe depression in the past. The Uni I was in had a lot of not so great people either. Anyway, at the tail end of December I attempted to take my life with scissors slicing my throat open but then the nurse caught me and I was under watch for the rest of the night at the uni. I was put under the National health care service (NHS) where their crisis team would check me everyday to make I hadn‚Äôt died or killed myself. They gave me two different medications which made me even worse. It messed up my brain chemistry. 

Everything from here happened in January.
Then in the beginning of January I was hurting myself by cutting my arms and legs with scissors and keys. Whereby then I went absolutely insane during one of their visits and they thought I was really gonna die so they forcefully admitted me into a psychiatric ward in the town over. If I didn‚Äôt come willingly they would‚Äôve forced me in there and sectioned me. So when I was there I was around many different people. Constantly hearing screams at night and completely delusional people as well. I was completely manic some days. I met this girl there. Her name was Wendy (19F). After staying the ward a couple days, we both realised we loved each other and got into a relationship. She was my first girlfriend. She had BPD. From that day we hung out all the time. Due to her BPD she can switch to someone horrible when she drinks too much. So when we went on a bender with another friend I made there by sneaking out of the hospital, I got incredibly drunk as we walked around town blasting music and drinking. So when we got back I couldn‚Äôt move because I was so drunk I may puke. But because she drank too much she switched and started calling me horrible names and everything. I cried. The next day she explained to me how the BPD works and that she‚Äôs sorry. I know how sweet and amazing she is in reality, plus I loved her. So I forgave her. Fast forward a couple of days she has to leave the ward because she‚Äôs been in too long and she deicdes to stays with her friend. Long story short, she stole money from me and tried to steal money from her the next morning. Kicking her out immediately that same morning. Wendy was depressed and hurt and I spent nearly 8 hours meeting up with her and finding her a place to live somewhere in town because she‚Äôs basically homeless. Lost 200 GBP in a stupid mistake in trying to get her lodging. I managed to get another friend I met in the ward to give her a place to stay. Then I went back to the ward myself. I was then told the next day that I was being discharged even though I wasn‚Äôt ready and I was terrified. None of the other patients want me to leave as they know I‚Äôm not ready but I just got an asshole doctor which discharged me. So a couple days pass and I‚Äôm sent back to my uni lodgings at night. The moment I enter my room I have a panic attack and hurt myself. I find out they forgot to give me my medicine too. I rush back that same night despite exhaustion and when ur each the hospital I break down in front of the ward. Crying and nearly vomiting on staff because I wanted to go back in. I was on the floor puking in the bathroom screaming and saying I was gonna kill myself. They said they couldn‚Äôt take me so they tried taking me to action and emergency. But then I was so scared. So they drugged me up heavily with Promethazine (Muscle relaxant) so that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to think or move or speak. And sent me back to the uni. So a couple days go by and I‚Äôm practically bed ridden in my room unable to speak without slurring due to the amount I‚Äôm given. The next day I‚Äôm made to be in a meeting with the head academic supervisor of the university and my school counsellor. They tell me that I either voluntarily leave the uni through withdrawing my visa or they force me out by eliminating my visa forcefully. By this point I was insane. So then I had to mediate between my dad and mum as I had to pretend I loved my dad more and want his support because he can afford to bring me back. So in essence I decided to withdraw my visa voluntarily. And my dad would come pick me up in a week. Then Wendy wanted to stay at my place for a day as she was free. So she came over and she slept over in my room. The next day I had to organise a meeting with the uni people including higher ups to prep them with what to say to my dad that would not legally get them in trouble or screw me over when he asks questions as if he‚Äôs mad my life may have been over. But while this is happening, Wendy was crying on the phone because her mother was being horrible and forced her away from me and she was breaking down on street in town while on the phone with me on the way to my meeting. After all that I went back to my room where before she was forced away she had cleaned my room. I broke down in tears crying. I still couldn‚Äôt rest, shortly after the crisis team came to check on me and I was completely manic and insane speaking to them. A couple days pass and Wendy is able to stay over now until my dad picks me up. She missed me and wanted to stay with me until then. So she comes over and we just hangout together and love each other. I made sure the laundry was done and the room tidy. That the bedsheets were clean and warm and that the coffee she loved I had. I set up movies, cuddle spaces, I gave her the best side of her bed and paid for her food. We had sex and I helped her open up more, and comfort her when her mother is being a horrible person. I help teach her to feel her feeling better. But then two nights before I leave, we decided to drink a little. I was against it but she promised she wouldn‚Äôt drink a lot so okay. I accidentally drink too much and I‚Äôm feeling sick. Wendy in the midst of finally feeling her own feelings for the first time in a while thinks she hurt me and tries kill herself in my bathroom while cutting up her body with a razor. So when she exited she had overdosed and was bleeding all over. Leaving my bathroom all red too. Im still heavily drunk so I keep feeling like puling but I try my best to remind her it‚Äôs all okay. She collapses and I think she died. I desperately get my neighbour to call the ambulance. I get them on the phone and Wendy wakes up to stop me from getting the ambulance to come saying she‚Äôs okay. I black out in my bed thinking she‚Äôs dying. I wake up and afraid she might be dying as we talk and all but I try to stay calm. So we talk and sort things out and she says she won‚Äôt do it again. We have a big dinner as it is our last night and I take her stargazing. The next day comes and I have to see my abusive dad. That happens. Instead of taking me to Malaysia he decides to use this opportunity to holiday. We reach the hotel and I‚Äôm shaking, panicking, crying, and shivering on the floor because of everything that has happened and is happening. He ignores me. A few days go bye and I keep in regular contact with Wendy and a friend Mark. Wendy is staying with Mark temporarily after she stayed with me. So those days pass while I‚Äôm jsut unable to do much without wanting to kill or hurt myself. Then I get horrible messages sent to me from Wendy. Completely insulting me and berating me. Calling me nasty things. I find out she tried kill herself again via overdose and my friend Mark drove her to action and emergency. She was spouting horrible things about him too so the hospital kicked him out. Then the last thing she told me was that she was dying and that I‚Äôm a horrible person. Her BPD activated because she was jsut beginning to feel her feelings and accept who she is, but also letting me in and not having her meds since she tried to overdose on them in my bathroom. Next thing I know she ran away from the hospital, threw her phone away in a random park and went missing. My dad continues to mess me up while I‚Äôm in the hotel. The whole thing with Wendy messed Mark up and he tied to kill himself multiple times while I tried to stop him over the phone. Then my dad took me on the plane back to Malaysia while being incredibly mad at me for panicking. I reached home and without medicine I was combatant trying to kill myself. I gave myself a concussion and tried to scratch my arms. My little brother threw away my self harm fork. I wa made to see a therapist which tried to put me in another ward which was the picture. I managed to avoid it somehow Then through a lot of begging behind the scenes I was allowed to see a psychiatrist. 

This is February.
My dad wanted to send me but he was getting mad while we were waiting in the hospital. He burst into my appointment and scolded my doctor then left. After my appointment, he was screaming how horrible my mum is in front of the hospital. The next couple days he tried to get me to cut all ties with my mum because he thinks she had an affair while they were married and is brainwashing us. He still hasn‚Äôt gotten over her. He tried to take legal action against me to leave his house because I might kill myself. Everyday it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm thirsty in a desert and there‚Äôs a huge bottle of water right in front of me. That water is to die. It‚Äôs like an itch to kill myself and I really want to scratch it every second. The new medication from the doctor has made me more sane now that I can speak and type. Without it I‚Äôd be unrecognisable. Completely insane, crazy, swearing, slurring, louder and just nuts. So after that I was given an ultimatum to either stay with my abusive father or live with my mum. The answer sounds easy but I couldn‚Äôt choose to stay with my mum. If I leave my dad, I‚Äôd lose out on inheritance I have been fighting for for 19 years, lose my ability to go overseas to study, my you‚Äôd be brother could lose stability, I‚Äôd force my mum back from her new life in Australia, strain her relationship there with her boyfriend and take money away from my brothers‚Äô future funds from my mum  to afford my education costs. I felt too guilty and couldn‚Äôt do it even if I may kill myself. My your younger brother and mum want me to stay with her but I just can‚Äôt. I‚Äôd would take away so much from everyone. Despite having done so much for all of them. So I sucked up to my dad and managed to avoid having to cut all ties with my mum. I still want to kill my self everyday. It is so hard not to do it. It drives me mad. I‚Äôm now visiting my mum and not killing is so hard. 

Obviously there‚Äôs a lot more detail but this is what has happened. I‚Äôll probably die soon.

Even before this my dad put me through so much Abuse. Physical, emotional, financial. He‚Äôs nearly killed me. I‚Äôm just so unlovable, I‚Äôm so fucking unlovable. I‚Äôm ugly, stupid, worthless and disgusting. Fuck me. Fuck this. I‚Äôm fucking tired. Fuck fuck fuck fuck. Nobody will ever love me. I know it‚Äôs wrong to peg your self perception on another person and I was working on that for years and it was getting better. But what if you life‚Äôs whole goal in the back of your mind was to find proof that you were capable of being loved and you finally got it? That‚Äôs how I felt. That my life was completed. That I was done with that part. But no. Of course not. Fuck me always fuck me. The meds are barely keeping me sane enough to eat talk, type and walk.

I don't think I'm worth anything. I hate myself. No matter how hard I push, no matter how much I try to be smart, to be perfect, anxiety always gets in the way. It paralyzes me, makes even the simplest things feel impossible. For weeks, I've been forcing myself to keep going, chasing perfect grades, because I have to, I'm studying fashion design in college, and graduation is just around the corner. On top of my classes, I'm making five looks, a project that's been consuming my life. Those looks will be showcased at graduation, and I've been pouring everything into them. But the stress has been overwhelming. I barely have time for anything, not even to eat some days. Still, there was a moment, a brief one, where I started to feel better. My looks were coming together beautifully. I was even a little excited, imagining myself modeling them, seeing my work come to life. But then, everything came crashing down. I found out I need to secure an internship with a company for at least four months in order to graduate. And in that moment, I felt like I was going to explode. What was all of this for? The time, the money, the stress, the anxiety, was it all wasted? I pushed myself to keep going, to be better, even when my anxiety made my voice tremble during presentations, even when I wanted to give up and cried myself to sleep. I kept fighting. And for what? Now, I might not even graduate. The thing I once loved, fashion design, has turned into my greatest fear, my biggest source of anxiety. I don't think I can do this anymore.

I'm only a 21F but I feel broken. Devastated. And worst of all, I feel like a burden to my family. I don't work, I don't contribute, and I know they had high expectations for me. But I'm just... nothing. No matter how hard I try, I can't seem to accomplish anything. My emotions exhaust them, when I open up, they either get mad at me or make me cry. But all I really need is support. A hug. Something to remind me that l'm not alone. I feel like I'm not good enough, so I've been punishing myself by not eating. Even smiling o laughing makes me feel guilty, like I don't deserve anything good right now.

I've had thoughts of ending my life before. But I always held on, thinking about my family, how much they've given me, how much I owe them. I kept going for them, for my friends, for the people who believe in me. But never for myself.

And now... now I feel so broken inside. The weight of it is unbearable. Living hurts more than anything. And I don't know how to keep going. Dying feels like the only relief.

1jlv2dt,2025-03-28T14:27:54,"Why is dying mad expensive
I see no reason to continue being here, every single day I get so anxious and insane over the fact that I exist. Selfish and horrendous to say but I don't give a bullcrap about my family, I could care less if they mourn me over if I go or not. Same goes with my friends, i love them of course, but no amount of that is enough to rival my yearning for nonexistence. I hate that I was forced to be alive in this world, and I had no say about it, everything was up to two adults who wanted pleasure. Honest to god because my parents did not had me for love, it was a one night drunken stupor caused by idiocracy that I had to suffer. I don't intensely hate them, but I would've love them to eternity if my mother succeeded in aborting me and my father failed at convincing her otherwise. Disclaimer though that they are asolutely not bad parents and provides as duty, but they def bad individuals lol.

I've been suicidal since forever, but have shitty pain tolerance so why am I still here? guess. The only ways out are either barbaric, violent and painful, or painless but mad expensive or unaffordable. Currently I'm planning on killing myself through asphyxia, by either helium or nitrogen gas tanks, but I'm a broke üçë univ. student so I can't even afford it, even though that was my dream death! It's painless and not barbaric at all, and almost guaranteed so long as I do it right. 

I think 60% of my reason why I want to die is because I couldn't be bothered living. You can list down reasons why people love living and I'll agree, but would kill myself anyways, that's how little I think of life. Why exactly am I saying all these? Just because. It's almost 10pm here and I hate how broke I am, and can't die as early as possible, so yes, I'm just venting.",dying mad expensive see reason continue every single day get anxious insane fact exist selfish horrendous say dont give bullcrap family could care less mourn go goes friends love course amount enough rival yearning nonexistence hate forced alive world say everything two adults wanted pleasure honest god parents love one night drunken stupor caused idiocracy suffer dont intensely hate wouldve love eternity mother succeeded aborting father failed convincing otherwise disclaimer though asolutely bad parents provides duty def bad individuals lol ive suicidal since forever shitty pain tolerance still guess ways either barbaric violent painful painless mad expensive unaffordable currently im planning killing asphyxia either helium nitrogen gas tanks im broke univ student cant even afford even though dream death painless barbaric almost guaranteed long right think 60 reason want die couldnt bothered living list reasons people love living ill agree would kill anyways thats little think life exactly saying almost 10pm hate broke cant die early possible yes im venting,2,1,0,Negative,High,[],[]
1jlysgj,2025-03-28T17:14:36,"Last ditch effort
This is a new account i made, where i would like to get some things off my chest. 

I‚Äôm 19, turning 20 in 2 weeks, and i‚Äôm having a hard time. 

The last 3 years i‚Äôve been at a very low point in my life, which made me start self harming and having numerous suicide attempts (started sh at 12, stopped - started at age 17 again). 

Right now i have a therapist who is great, we get along really well and can laugh and have fun often, and be serious when need be. But lately i‚Äôm struggling really bad and it feels like i can‚Äôt get out of it.

I also regularly hang out with a CPS worker who is helping me out during this time. But i can‚Äôt do this much longer

Yesterday i texted both my therapist and CPS worker that i want to quit. I think about quitting therapy alot in regards to it being easier for me to attempt with them not in the picture anymore. 

A year ago to the date (28. march 2024) i woke up from a week long coma after an attempt, and i‚Äôm really struggling with that thought, because i to this day, wish i died that time. My therapist cried when she saw me again after, and i don‚Äôt do well with people caring - because that‚Äôs not how i was raised.

I was raised with an absent father, a suicidal and alcoholic mother. I was never front and center, i was all the way in the back, me and my siblings. I have also struggled with drinking, and suicide so i thought out of everyone, mom would understand the best. But no. She gets mad when i‚Äôm sad, i can‚Äôt talk about my feelings because it makes her feel bad. When i open up, she says ""just don‚Äôt do that, don‚Äôt feel that, just be happy"", when she knows damn well that it doesn‚Äôt work like that. 

I used to steal my moms medicine to OD on, and last year i was able to get that prescription in my name, so i can pick it up every 2 weeks. I have picked them up every 2 weeks for a few months now, but i‚Äôve never taken them. They‚Äôre in my cabinet right now and the only thing i can think of is taking them. 

I told my mom about the pills i had in my cabinet and gave them to her a month ago, but 2 days ago i asked for them back. She knows about my history with those pills and got concerned (because someone recently stole my motorcycle helmet so i was in a bad mood), and she told me ""If you take them all at once, i‚Äôll never forgive you"". It makes me feel like a horrible human being for even thinking about wanting to die, but i can‚Äôt help it. 

This year was looking so good: I may start school again in august, plans on getting my motorcycle license, house renovations and just all in all, it seems like it should be a good year. But all i can think about is dying. 

When my cats move back home to my moms, i‚Äôm planning on driving my moped down a steep hill and crash it, if that‚Äôs not possible (not gonna do anything that could harm others on the road), i‚Äôm going to drive somewhere, stab myself in the leg and see what happens. 

The reason i‚Äôm calling this post a last ditch effort, is because it all depends on how these 2-3 weeks go. It‚Äôs stupid, but i honestly don‚Äôt know how to keep on going. 

I‚Äôm not living, i‚Äôm just here, fighting and surviving. Life should be more than just surviving, i WANT to live. Maybe i‚Äôll live a better life in death than in reality.

Since nobody in real life can help me, i‚Äôm taking to the internet as a last cry for help. Depression,  cognitive decline, and loneliness has completely destroyed my life. I (21M) have isolated myself for the past year after falling into a deep depressive episode after one panic attack, and i have become a completely different person. I lost my job, and basically just sit on my ass playing video games and sleeping as much as possible hoping i don‚Äôt wake up. 

The worst part of this is the cognitive changes and the loneliness. I go days without even hearing another souls voice, and my memory and thinking ability is so impaired i can‚Äôt remember what i had for dinner yesterday and my mind is completely void of thought 24/7

Whenever i have tried to talk to people, i just can‚Äôt because i can‚Äôt think anymore and my personality is just gone. i don‚Äôt even talk to my parents anymore. i‚Äôm just like a zombie. I feel like my life is being wasted and i could have never imagined that life could get this bad.

I am scared to even step outside of my house anymore. Doctors have found nothing wrong with my brain and therapy/ medication has not worked. I think of suicide every day, any advice or encouragement would be appreciated because i am truly on the edge of life and death.

1jlt2h6,2025-03-28T12:41:08,"Suicidal ideation without the drive to end it is a nightmare.
I see no point in anything. I'm going through a very difficult time right now. I have health issues that require weekly physical therapy and am always sick with something. Someone is always mad at me for something when literally all I do is keep to myself and only ever engage with people who engage with me first. I do not guilt people into staying in my life and yet they feel the need to lash out at me and use me as their punching bag whenever they're having a hard time.

I have no support system because I've been struggling with depression since I was 13 and no one likes a mentally ill person who takes too long to recover. No amount of improvement that I do will ever be enough for anyone so long as I still have times where I struggle or am down. 

Example: I was overall doing well 2 years ago, then was faced with homelessness. When I reached out to my best friend about my struggles -- she told me that I could do so whenever I needed, so I saw no issue in reaching out to her about this -- she lashed out at me and yelled at me for ""always being two steps away from a breakdown."" When, again, I hadn't mentioned my mental health at all for a full year before homelessness. 

So I genuinely understand that me being mentally ill is a problem and me talking to anyone about my struggles is a problem. I get that. I am doing everything I can to change that and I apologize for being mentally ill.

I do not want to live. I do not want to continue living. I hate who I am, I hate my life, I hate how lonely I am, I hate how much other people hate me.

 I'm the problem, I have always been the problem, and the kindest thing I can do is get rid of the problem. 

But I can't do it. For the first time in my life, I have the suicidal ideation without the actual drive to kill myself. I can't even get to the point of making a plan, as badly as I want to. It's unthinkable.

But so is living when I'm such a horrific human being. Even when my mouth is shut and I keep to myself, I somehow manage to piss people off.

I wish people understood how sorry I am that I'm just inherently an awful person. I know people will read this and assume I'm fishing for compliments or sympathy. I'm not. I'm genuinely an awful, awful person and I wish people understood that I would get rid of myself for their well being if only I could.",suicidal ideation without drive end nightmare see point anything im going difficult time right health issues require weekly physical therapy always sick something someone always mad something literally keep ever engage people engage first guilt people staying life yet feel need lash use punching bag whenever theyre hard time support system ive struggling depression since 13 one likes mentally ill person takes long recover amount improvement ever enough anyone long still times struggle example overall well 2 years ago faced homelessness reached best friend struggles told could whenever needed saw issue reaching lashed yelled always two steps away breakdown hadnt mentioned mental health full year homelessness genuinely understand mentally ill problem talking anyone struggles problem get everything change apologize mentally ill want live want continue living hate hate life hate lonely hate much people hate im problem always problem kindest thing get rid problem cant first time life suicidal ideation without actual drive kill cant even get point making plan badly want unthinkable living im horrific human even mouth shut keep somehow manage piss people wish people understood sorry im inherently awful person know people read assume im fishing compliments sympathy im im genuinely awful awful person wish people understood would get rid well could,5,1,0,Negative,High,[],[]

We started talking and we started dating. I was finally happy. Everything was doing great. I was still in long distance with this guy. I moved to another country he was in different country. We started doing this online long distance relationship. He is a great guy but He never publicly acknowledged our relationship. We dated each other for 5 years. During the dating time, he never told his friends about me. I wanted to know where this was going. But, nothing. He told his mom and sister about me. I was taking to his mum once in a while. During these 5 years, my depression was on and off. I was going through dark times. I couldn‚Äôt make friends. So, all I did was work and study. 
Then I lost my dad. He came to my dad‚Äôs funeral. He flew to different county for me to support during this time. But, he didnot meet me. He went out with his friends and spent time with them. But he told me and fam that he came here for me. I was going through really hard time. I got responsibilities. His family was really supportive. He told his dad about me. His family decided we should married. I wasn‚Äôt ready as I didnot get time to grief my father. Because when I lost him, I was busy organising his funeral, helping my mother and removing debts. I said yes, as it would make my mother happy. I am married now to this guy. He is good. But, we are doing h th is long distance again. I am feeling depressed and lonely again. He promised he would come and stay until I finish with my studies and wrap up from here and now he is saying he will come but not sure when. I am loosing my shit. Throughout the relationship, he is being unreliable, self-centered. He is not the same person like he was before marriage. 
I am not sure if it‚Äôs him or me. But I really help you figure out what should I do. Also if someone can drop easy ways to go. I am really tired and I wanted to die.

Lately, I've been feeling that I copy whatever my friends or a random stranger do. Like if my friend listens to music and sleeps every day, I try to do that, but it becomes an epic fail.

I have started to masturbate frequently and this has become an issue for me. I try to overcome this sadness but I haven't been able to for my entire college life.

I'm seriously thinking about leaving my current job. I currently live alone 2 hours away from my parents. I had a girlfriend here who left me and I had to go live alone (bad story i had been gaslighted and treated so bad). I work 20 km from my workplace (which means an hour's drive there and an hour's drive back in traffic), to earn 1340 euros a month (I work about 40 hours a week), but all this pace is making me seriously stressed (I have a difficult job, I'm an educator who works in a nursing home with the elderly and managing families, colleagues, long working hours is not easy) unfortunately here at home I always have little time, because I'm tired to carry on friendships, hobbies or anything else. (i had a terrible period between december and january, because at work we had worked understaffed , i start had social anxiety, drinkin and crying alone especially in the holidays alone, i start felt like so bad and alone while everyone was having fun , my car broke down and i had to pay a lot to mechanic)

I had risked life twice when i was driving at home from work. The first time I found myself on a level crossing in the dark, without even seeing a traffic light and the barriers were coming down. A second time I entered a road the wrong way without realizing that that was the wrong road.

I play the guitar, I go out every now and then, I love listening to music and reading and doing graphics. I'm seriously thinking about going back home to my family and starting over. It's really hard to put money away, everything here costs double and I'm always anxious that something won't break.

1idbugy,2025-01-30T03:26:54,"slowly realizing i am not as okay as i thought
I am a 23-year-old woman about to graduate college, and to put it plainly, I‚Äôve lived a relatively normal, stereotypical life for an American female‚Äîmiddle-class family, small town, graduated high school at the top of my class, went to college nearby, and now I‚Äôm preparing to move six hours away to start my dream job. I‚Äôve been incredibly fortunate to have two married parents, a stable home, and food on the table. My childhood was, for the most part, uneventful, with the exception of my dad‚Äôs temper issues, which were rough until he was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in my high school years. Once he started treatment, things got better, and overall, I can‚Äôt say I had a difficult upbringing.

I‚Äôve spent my entire life trying to be the kid my parents never had to worry about. I got good grades, made friends, participated in sports, and never caused trouble. I‚Äôve always been extremely independent, which in many ways has served me well, but it has also left me with the habit of handling everything alone, even when I probably shouldn‚Äôt.

When it comes to relationships, I dated my high school boyfriend for five years before realizing he had fallen in love with my friend. I broke up with him, and while I was never angry at him, it took me a long time to stop blaming myself. He and my friend are getting married next year, and I hold no resentment toward them‚ÄîI‚Äôve accepted that we weren‚Äôt right for each other. But for a long time, I genuinely believed it was my fault that he stopped loving me, and that mindset sent me into a spiral that took years to untangle.

My next relationship was with a guy I met on a dating app. Partway through, he got his ex pregnant. He swore the baby wasn‚Äôt his, and we went through the entire paternity test ordeal before learning he had been lying about the timeline of their relationship. 

After that, I started dating someone I met while working as a counselor at a summer camp, but about a year in, I found out he was sleeping with his roommate. He broke up with me to be with her.

Most recently, I was with a military guy who had serious alcohol and drug issues. There‚Äôs too much to say about that situation, but it ended in a spectacularly messy way. Instead of just admitting he wasn‚Äôt relationship material, he created elaborate lies and tried to make me look insane to everyone in my small town. Fortunately, people who know me saw through it, and my dad even confronted him at a bar and got back some money he owed me from a trip we took together. This all happened last month, and I‚Äôm still struggling with the aftermath. Even though I‚Äôve been reassured I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, I keep questioning myself, wondering if I could have done something differently. I‚Äôve been reading about the paranoia that comes with substance abuse, trying to understand why he acted the way he did, but it hasn‚Äôt made me feel any better.

The real reason I‚Äôm writing this is because, for the first time, I‚Äôm realizing I am not as emotionally stable as I thought I was. I‚Äôve always considered myself strong and put-together, but now, I feel like I don‚Äôt trust myself. I constantly assume that everything is my fault. My least favorite icebreaker question is, ‚ÄúTell me three things you love about yourself,‚Äù because I can never think of anything. I hate talking about myself. I am about to graduate with two degrees, and yet, I almost settled for an alcoholic with a drug problem because I thought it was the best I could do.

I take care of myself physically‚ÄîI work out, eat well, and put effort into my appearance‚Äîyet I don‚Äôt like the way I look. I know I‚Äôm not objectively unattractive, but I still struggle to see myself as good enough. When people compliment me, I assume they‚Äôre just trying to be nice. My mom recently got mad at me when she found out I had made the Dean‚Äôs List every semester for five years and never once mentioned it to her. It never occurred to me to tell her because I didn‚Äôt think it was a big deal. In my mind, being on the Dean‚Äôs List wasn‚Äôt an accomplishment‚Äîit was an obligation that came with going to college.

My friends have pointed out that I am way more compassionate toward them than I am toward myself. They tell me I need to stop being so hard on myself, but I don‚Äôt know how. I can‚Äôt seem to step outside my own head long enough to see myself the way they see me. No matter how much I achieve, I always feel like I am not enough. Worse, I feel like the people around me secretly think I‚Äôm annoying, embarrassing, or failing in some way.

Anyway, I don't want to be dramatic and say I hate myself or whatever, but I am finding it so difficult to see that I am worthy of being happy, or that I am all the good things I hear about myself. Therapy is not an option for me right now, so I guess I am asking if you have similar issues, how you tackle the self care aspect of your life and how you get yourself out of these holes.",slowly realizing okay thought 23yearold woman graduate college put plainly ive lived relatively normal stereotypical life american femalemiddleclass family small town graduated high school top class went college nearby im preparing move six hours away start dream job ive incredibly fortunate two married parents stable home food table childhood part uneventful exception dads temper issues rough diagnosed depression anxiety high school years started treatment things got better overall cant say difficult upbringing ive spent entire life trying kid parents never worry got good grades made friends participated sports never caused trouble ive always extremely independent many ways served well also left habit handling everything alone even probably shouldnt comes relationships dated high school boyfriend five years realizing fallen love friend broke never angry took long time stop blaming friend getting married next year hold resentment toward themive accepted werent right long time genuinely believed fault stopped loving mindset sent spiral took years untangle next relationship guy met dating app partway got ex pregnant swore baby wasnt went entire paternity test ordeal learning lying timeline relationship started dating someone met working counselor summer camp year found sleeping roommate broke recently military guy serious alcohol drug issues theres much say situation ended spectacularly messy way instead admitting wasnt relationship material created elaborate lies tried make look insane everyone small town fortunately people know saw dad even confronted bar got back money owed trip took together happened last month im still struggling aftermath even though ive reassured didnt anything wrong keep questioning wondering could done something differently ive reading paranoia comes substance abuse trying understand acted way hasnt made feel better real reason im writing first time im realizing emotionally stable thought ive always considered strong puttogether feel like dont trust constantly assume everything fault least favorite icebreaker question tell three things love never think anything hate talking graduate two degrees yet almost settled alcoholic drug problem thought best could take care physicallyi work eat well put effort appearanceyet dont like way look know im objectively unattractive still struggle see good enough people compliment assume theyre trying nice mom recently got mad found made deans list every semester five years never mentioned never occurred tell didnt think big deal mind deans list wasnt accomplishmentit obligation came going college friends pointed way compassionate toward toward tell need stop hard dont know cant seem step outside head long enough see way see matter much achieve always feel like enough worse feel like people around secretly think im annoying embarrassing failing way anyway dont want dramatic say hate whatever finding difficult see worthy happy good things hear therapy option right guess asking similar issues tackle self care aspect life get holes,2,9,0,Neutral,Low,[],[]

I have OCD and no therapist until, at least, Easter. I was struggling quite badly again yesterday and ended up having a breakdown throwing stuff at the wall, even though I desperately want to fix things. My mother walked in and finally drove me to the train station where I begged my boyfriend to stay for the night. My relationship with my mother is really bad, which I feel guilty for, and I am sure she will be sad for the whole week now.

I‚Äôm 17 years old, writing this in January 2025.

I do believe I have autism, and so my two pedestrians. I haven‚Äôt been properly diagnosed because it cost a lot of money and/or takes years to get tested, I‚Äôve been on waiting lists for a long time. Also I might have ptsd because  my childhood was very very physiologically traumatic. I don‚Äôt think I should go into detail because of the sever rules. I have/had anxiety, depression and just all of those things that are kinda common.

I feel like my thoughts are constantly speeding 24/7, and I have crippling insomnia. I very often think intensely deep while dissociating. In the past year, I get the feeling where I know too much or I just understand too easily. Except it wasn‚Äôt about school, it was about this thing that I can‚Äôt explain at all. I call it ‚Äúidk‚Äù. ‚Äúidk‚Äù is like infinitely impossible to explain. 

I feel like I‚Äôm on a different frequency than everyone and that I see reality in ways I could never explain. It‚Äôs like most human‚Äôs brains were coded to process information in a common pattern. But my brain doesn‚Äôt follow that pattern. instead of doing up down left and right, my brain goes somewhere else. It‚Äôs like everyone‚Äôs brain follows a track that turns to the right, but mine turns to the left. I physically cannot turn right because my track goes the left. And others can‚Äôt turn left because their track goes to the right.


I feel like careers jobs education money and just all those human things are just not it. To me it seems like lost opportunity, and ineffective. I don‚Äôt seek to fit in with others or need validation. 

I‚Äôm the past months and especially recently, I‚Äôve been feeling hopeless, stuck, yk all the things you can think of. But I also feel like I‚Äôm dying, and I feel ok with it. I feel like that‚Äôs the most agreeable, thumbs up, ok, understandable thing that has ever been in my brain. It isn‚Äôt the answer to my questions, and I don‚Äôt want to die, I‚Äôm just very ok with it. it‚Äôs this thing that is perfect and beautifully neutral in all imaginal ways possible.  I feel like I‚Äôve just been coming to conclusions in my head, I can‚Äôt describe it but all I can say is just, I get it.


I could keep talking about my thoughts and feelings but I want to wrap this up now. Please just give me anything you can, maybe all I need is to hear some random thing from someone else. Just give me what you got. I guess the big concern here is my current state and I don‚Äôt think I can help myself anymore. I have lived my life helping myself to push myself, but this work is getting way too heavy and I need help. I have done a lot, there are people that are very informed on me and try to help me, but I think I may never find help. 

If you have any questions I will answer them. Like if you need more info about a specific thing I said, I will have more things to say about it.

1i5sv33,2025-01-20T16:35:38,"My mental health is dwindling and I don‚Äôt know what to do
  This lengthy post pertains to my 43 year old wife and 18 year old step daughter. I‚Äôm a 35 year old male and I feel like my mental health is almost non existent after being in this relationship for 8 years. I could go on for days with numerous stories. But for the sake of time I‚Äôll do a quick recap of a few instances to see if I‚Äôm crazy or if I can find some sort solace.

  Some background is that my SD has autism. The therapist has said that she is very well adjusted and is capable living a good life and is capable of living on her own. My wife has bipolar, PTSD, anxiety, and schizophrenia. Due to a very traumatic childhood. I have ADHD and possibly some sort anxiety due to events that have occurred throughout this relationship.

  What I fear is that due to my wife‚Äôs upbringing is that she would rather play the role of best friend than the role of parent to avoid any kind of conflict with her daughter. When any sort of parenting needs to be done her daughter will be stand offish and twist words to such an extent that her mom almost completely checks out. Just to note we dont yell or curse at her. We sit down and try to explain how her actions hurt her and can hurt others. She somehow always blame others or us. The bio dad never has held her accountable and some times agree with that it is other people just wanting to be mean to her. One time she got a email from her art teacher that her assignment was not within guidelines and need to be redone. The bio dad‚Äôs response was ‚Äúwell all art teachers are d*cks‚Äù.

  In recent events, SD was not doing her school work in a timely manner when at her dad‚Äôs house. My wife tried suggesting that she get started so she could she could get her full hours in. Almost automatically she starts saying that she doesn‚Äôt want too and will do it later. The wife then explains she will only have like two hours of work done instead of the standard five. The SD then starts getting disrespectful with her and starts outright refusing. She gets off the phone and messages back two hours later saying that she is done with her work.  So that shows she did not do what was expected in the standard school day. We have gotten numerous emails from teachers that she has not turned in work or is doing it so fast that it is resulting in bad grades. The worst is when we was informed that she didn‚Äôt turn in a whole month of work. When asked she said that the teacher said that since she has a ISP that she didn‚Äôt have to do it. The teacher said that was not the case. when in a doctor‚Äôs sessions SD admitted that she just didn‚Äôt want to do the work. When asked by us again she tried to back track and lie to us again about the situation.

 So when we finally got the SD back this weekend. My wife brought up how she felt disrespected and was only trying to help her down the right path. SD then starts to say that she was disrespected and intimidated. When nobody was yelling or threatening any sort of punishment. The next day she proceeds to tell her mom ‚Äú I‚Äôm just a disappointment and I feel like you guys are going to withhold food‚Äù.  Not once was any of that said. We don‚Äôt believe in doing that to any person. Especially since my wife was denied food and many other cruel punishments as a child. I finally had enough and told my SD what she said was ridiculous that we would never do such a thing and she knows that. My wife then tells her daughter the story about how she was denied food and would never do that to any body. The wife told her that comment about withholding food really hurt her feelings. SD that says ‚Äú well my feelings was hurt‚Äù. 

  I just feel like I‚Äôm going crazy. Every time something occurs SD goes into a frenzy that makes her mom and me so anxious. Most of the time the wife and I argue because she would rather leave it be then deal with the fallout of holding her daughter accountable. The wife says that she don‚Äôt want to loose her daughter by making do what is expected of her at this age. I tell her that if her daughter doesn‚Äôt shape up that she‚Äôs not going to be live the life that she wants. That we will have to live in this near constant anxious state the rest of our lives because the SD will most likely still will be living at home because she lives in this fantasy land that she doesn‚Äôt do anything wrong. 

 Two last things to say that shows how I feel like my mental health is at a major decline.

1) I had to go see a heart specialist due to how anxious or upset I get due to the stress of everything.

2) SD doesn‚Äôt like needles. So one time when she was getting a blood draw. She went into such a frenzy that a nurse thought she was getting beat at home. The hospital got CPS involved and sent someone out. The CPS worker concluded that there was no abuse and the SD was just being disruptive. I think that‚Äôs when I started to get these anxiety attacks because I was working at an elementary school that I rathered enjoy and felt like a visit from CPS would jeopardize my livelihood/safety.

So please if there is any advice that can be given or if anyone that has been in a similar situation. Please post any ideas or stories it would be very much appreciated.

My head is the strange place. It‚Äôs the clich√© answer, the one no one wants to hear, but it‚Äôs the truth. I am the strange place. My brain gets stuck on random thoughts and won‚Äôt let them go, no matter what I do. I get caught in their cycle and start to lose faith in anything. Feeling like I can‚Äôt do anything, I‚Äôm speaking from a deep, dark hole of nothingness into which I stumbled.

My brain doesn‚Äôt work like other people‚Äôs. I misinterpret almost everything with a negative slant. I can‚Äôt trust my head. It leads me astray and badgers me incessantly. My head led me into a partial hospitalization program and away from my friends. It sends me into a panic at things other people wouldn‚Äôt even notice. Like some evolutionary quirk, my head has lost its self-preservation instincts and is trying to destroy me from within. I have to fight against it to see any semblance of joy.

I can‚Äôt blame anyone else: it‚Äôs me. It‚Äôs my chemistry, my neural pathways. And so, I dedicate all of my work and energy into fighting what I can‚Äôt be rid of: my own mind. I‚Äôm determined to find a way to wrangle it under my control and coax it into repose.

What would it be like to have a normal mind‚Äîone that wants me to succeed, not crumble and wither under a rock? I catch glimpses of a healthier mind when I take an anti-anxiety medication: what it feels like to be normal. It wears off in about three hours, and then the dread sets in, but at least I get a glimpse. A glimpse into the ease of existence.

1hw8ku5,2025-01-08T03:01:27,"LONG story, just putting this out there to see if anyone can relate and let me know I'm not alone
In Elementary through early high school I was bullied. I was always the tiny quiet white kid so I was a target for bullying that wasn't exactly severe but it was continuous for most of my life. I think this has been the root of much of my issues. 

One I got into high school I always had a deep need for connection and yearning. After COVID we came back and I got into a big friend group. I didn't realize how bad of an influence many of those kids were at the time because I was still a dumb teen like we all were, but I expectedly got into trouble due to hanging out with them. 

I started skipping classes, got into fights, got obsessed with following drama. I never had friends like that, that at the time seemed great because they were the only people in my life to give me lots of ""respect"" and affection.

I hungout with the group before and sometimes after school, at the parking lot across the street. It was a big group, probably the biggest group of the school. If you were in it, you knew almost everyone and almost everyone knew you. Until I met them, I never had any meaningful connections with people. I never had a girlfriend until then, only had a few friends every grade at the most.



I have had a severe feeling of loneliness for years. This resulted in a lot of embarrassing moments. For one example; a girl in the group that I was friends with, who I'll call A. I had a crush on A and developed an obsessive relationship that makes me cringe so much when I look back on it. 

Whenever she wouldn't answer my texts immediately, I would fly into a silent rage and yelled at her one time through text. This whole thing caused some of the group to be divided over my reactions to everything, some thought (knew) I overreacted to put it lightly. Some got her to apologize to me which was bs.

When A started dating one of my friends, I got jealous. I wanted to be with her so bad that I got nightmares of her having sex with him, and was always scared that they would end up doing it. When I eventually found out they did, my heart was pounding and I got depressed over it. 

Eventually I got over it and didn't care anymore once the relationship wasn't relevant to me and there was never a chance. Also she cheated on her boyfriend so I dodged a bullet there. Though I guess she also dodged me, to be fair. 

I think this whole obsession towards being with someone and whatnot, started in 8th grade. There was this one girl who had a crush on me so hard that she basically sexually harassed me the whole year. I won't go into detail here, the stories with her are kind of funny thinking about it, but if the roles were reversed I'd be getting a teacher's meeting lol.

At first I didn't like her but after while I developed a crush, obsessing and fantasizing over her. Never got with her obviously, but all of that must have awakened something in me because I never even cared about relationships or sex until that point.



In Junior year of HS, there was another girl in the group. She was a crazy goth chick, who I'll call Z. She hated men and wanted them to go extinct, yet she got ran through by half the guys in the school. She started drama and fights with all of her exes and claimed all of her 300 exes were abusive or rapists. To be fair to myself, most of this info I didn't know until long after I broke up with her, but the red flags were still bright and waving in the sky. I was so desperate for love that I accepted when she asked me out.

Z was my first girlfriend and sadly my first kiss. I was so unused to affection that whenever any girl would hug me I would freeze and my mind would short-circuit. She found out about my lack of affection so she put up some type of act about caring about me, she made it her job to always give me affection (hugs, forehead kisses). Looking back I know she just did all that to make her last ex (who I was friends with at the time) jealous. But then that all got me hooked onto not just her but that friend group.

It didn't take long for drama to start. Basically, one of her exes apparently raped her once and after they broke up he kept following her around like a lost puppy, also his sister was talking about killing everyone in the group. This was all her words because she was yapping to the group about this. So what decision do I automatically take? I want to fight the guy ü§£. At this time I wasn't dating Z or even liked her, we were just acquaintances. I knew the fight was a stupid decision, and I kept debating with myself if I should be doing that or not, kept thinking on how to get away with it.

Some force kept making me ignore the rational thinking. Looking back, it was clearly because due to my past of being bullied, my life was riddled with experiences of being put down and made to feel weak. That fight was my chance to finally earn respect and feel tough like everyone else. So I went for it. Me and some of the group waited to catch him outside one day, and one day we finally did, but I hesitated and he ran away. I spent that whole week building up a false confidence to fight him. Then, one other day, we finally caught him off guard at a location across the street.

He was sitting at a bench and I went over and punched him and the fight started. It was a pretty boring fight, I threw haymakers every once in awhile and chased him as he tried to run away. I never even noticed because the memory is so blurry but he was actually throwing punches, I couldn't tell because the dude was comically weak but he was actually hitting me with his phone. He was one of the football players at the school so he finally hit me with a little tackle and we fell to the ground. 

For some reason even though he had me on the ground, he just sat there and let me punch his face in from the ground. Two girls came over, held him up and positioned him for me to punch him again. Jumping is pussy as hell but I was blinded by anger so I hit him one more time. I walked over to the group and noticed some looking at me in horror as I felt something cold on my forehead. 

Since he used his phone as a weapon on me, I got cut on the head and was bleeding like crazy, I looked like I got shot in the face. But despite all that I was smiling because I felt I was going to get a lot of so-called respect from it. The scar on my forehead healed and is no longer visible but I still have a wonky looking finger from my bad punching form.

I became a bit of a celebrity in the group and let it all go to my head. When I started dating Z, it was just weeks until drama happened again. That friend that I mentioned earlier who was one of her exes, he got into some goofy drama with her so I went through the same motions as the last time, it was just deja vu on steroids. I knew that fighting him wasn't a good idea but I did it anyways.

However this fight was different. I didn't lose exactly but we both basically looked like toddlers fighting. It was embarassing and the respect I had immediately disappeared. Even people who weren't in that group or had anything to do with the fight ditched me or just changed personalities out of nowhere.

 There were two ""friends"" I had that acted normal with me until that fight, then all of a sudden they started picking on me, constantly belittling me and bragging about how I'm small and they'd send me to the hospital if we ever fought because they were at least 100 pounds heavier. It was non-stop.

I broke up with Z right after the fight. While I brought the entire situation on myself when you think about it, the sheer domino effect that resulted from that situation still affects me now.



I became extremely insecure about my ability to fight and defend myself. I became untrusting, wary, and angry at people around me. I got obsessed with following martial arts and wanted to be a magically unstoppable god because I didn't like that anybody on Earth could beat me in a fight. I know this all sounds like a supervillain backstory but this was my mind. 

I would get angry at seeing violence in media where someone gets beat up when they didn't deserve it. I hate words like ""ass beating"", ""ass whooping"", ""ass kicking"". I hate words like that because I know what it's like to be in a vulnerable spot like that and to have people say you ""Got your ass beat"", especially if you were a victim, is extremely hurtful but I've never heard of anyone having that same pet peeve as me. It makes me feel alone. 

I wanted to go to the gym, bulk up, and get into fighting. It became a daily obsession that I couldn't get over. I didn't have the drive to actually hit the gym so I just gained an appetite after getting onto a blue-collar job and went from 120 pounds to 160 in a few years. After the next relationship and inevitable breakup, I lost the obsession or drive to fight and become the ""magically unstoppable god"", but the above paragraph still holds true to me now. 

Whenever I would vent about my fighting obsession to people or of how the two ""friends"" I mentioned before treated me, people just invalidated my problem and basically told me to get over it because it was ""tough love and just the way boys talk to each other"".



The issue of the fighting obsession would follow me into the next relationship. In the summer of 2022 I met one of the girls that used to be my elementary school classmate. I'll call her S. We found each other on Instagram and we met at our old elementary. We got together shortly afterwards and the relationship actually started out great. 

It started out loving and caring. She would tell me a lot about her past trauma and family issues. Her dad, Curtis, used to beat her and her brother when they were little. She got cornered by a boy in elementary, in the restroom, she didn't tell me any more details, all the kids at school made fun of her over it and called her weird. She would tell me about her ex problems, like one about how she broke up with a guy who proceeded to stalk her at her house and Curtis chased him away and threatened to shove a gun up his ass.

There were a couple things that weren't clear to me at first; How the abuse and trauma affected S and how her dad was treating her. The turmoil that would happen in the relationship comes down to my unresolved problems and hers as well. Also a lack of meeting in person. Most of the relationship was on Instagram because we could barely get any chances to see each other.

At first, I didn't recognize the terrible way her dad was treating her. He was always nice to me the whole time and at the beginning of the relationship the verbal abuse was very subtle, but it quickly became a lot less so. He would always yell and scream at S for any little reason possible, and always framed it as tough love and ""telling it how it is"". He said one time ""life is too short to be nice to people"".

Apparently the physical abuse of her childhood stopped when her mom got fed up with it but it just turned into verbal abuse afterwards. However, one time while we were together (in the relationship) her dad hit her, pulled her hair, and hit her mom over a stupid argument. 

She had lots of health problems for someone who was 19, like arthritis, carpel tunnel, and alpha gal syndrome. She couldn't eat much meat and her health was going downhill. They had an argument about medicine and I guess he got mad enough to hit people.

It was awkward having to go over to his house and pretend nothing happened. I wanted to fight him but I had finally learned from the first two fights that it wouldn't be worth it. I'd either get beat up, or shot. I hated that all I could do was just ignore the whole situation, I hate the powerlessness of it.

That was the gist of that whole situation, but the relationship still remained strong for awhile. However the honeymoon phase ended in just a few months, and as the arguments began, the relationship became chaotic from there. The arguments looking back were very minor, in a normal relationship these would not have been big deals at all. 

One example, I had vented to her one time about my fighting obsession and she gave me advice, but part of the advice was that you can't win every fight and that to become a better fighter you have to get ""fucked up to fuck somebody up"". I didn't want to hear that because I wanted to instantly be unstoppable. I never wanted to feel the embarrassment and other people's shame at me losing a fight. 

She said that if I didn't like the advice and didn't want to lose, then I didn't want to fight. She was basically saying that if I couldn't handle losing, I shouldn't be a fighter, which is true, but the issue here is that I don't think she fully comprehended my problem, and I didn't at the time either. 

Everything I'm writing here I'm able to because I've had a lot of time to personally grow and figure out my own mind. I never wanted to be a fighter, I just wanted to be left alone for once in my life. She thought I just wanted to fight but that was just all a way of coping. The argument escalated and I got exhausted from it and cut it off. She got upset about that and asked ""Are you going to go to sleep every time we have an argument?"". 

I basically said ""No but this argument is stressing me out too much, I need a break"" and she called me a dickhead and said if I didn't want to talk to her then I shouldn't ever talk to her. Then all of that ended. I could barely sleep that night, when I woke up I sent an apology to her and went to work dreading the breakup to happen. 

She texted me back eventually and said ""I want to give you a hug. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have called you a dickhead I was just so upset"". We made up after that and the relationship actually seemed stronger afterwards, but now that I can look back I know that it was a big crack in the foundation. That was the beginning of a chaotic and up-and-down rest of the relationship. We didn't have many arguments, but they were all pretty stupid.

There was one where me, S, and her friends were in a group chat. I almost had to go to jury duty one time but I wasn't picked. I sent the chat the pic of the confirmation but S let me know I had my address in there on accident so I deleted it. 

She told me to be careful and not give out info like that and I was like ""Ok, but it's alright. If you're friends with them I'm sure it wouldn't have ended bad"". Then she repeated what she said and I repeated and we kept going over and over about it. When the argument was finally over we apologized again and that was the end of that.

Another argument was a really goofy one, about what you call different Japanese swords. It's hard to remember what this was all about. We were talking about katanas and somehow we got into it about that and she kept calling different swords different names, but you try and look them up the names are nowhere to be found. 

We kept going on and on about it and it escalated. I sent her a Wikipedia article about Japanese swords and she dismissed it like ""Wikipedia is an unreliable source"", like every single article is incorrect, to the point where even definitions of words are all incorrect just because it's Wikipedia ü§£. 

We went on and on and I got so tired of it that I said something that was admittedly stupid. I was like ""Are you on drugs?"" That made her angry and she said ""You're making me feel stupid, I know what I'm talking about"". I don't remember anything else from that confusing argument, but it ended the same way the others did. 

Now, onto what ended the relationship. I went over to her dad's house and he was talking about fighting, how we grew up small so he had to learn how to fight. He bragged about being 140 pounds, and being in over 200 fights and only losing 4. 

He talked about how his son accidentially knocked into him once which made him black out in rage and threw his son against the wall. He talked about almost knocking his son out one time. He'd always say he never hits women even though that evidently wasn't true and one time he had an attitude with S, which she gave back to him and he got mad and said ""I'd never hit a woman but I want to"".

In the discussion about fighting, he said ""If any of my kids get their asses beat they can't come home"". That threw me off but I just acted one ear and out the other. When I got home I texted her and complained about the shit he was saying. She said ""Yeah but I wouldn't have it any other way, it's just tough love"". 

She always complained about her dad's parenting and how he contributed to her trauma. But now all of a sudden a switch is flipped and she defends him? I always felt like people just toy with me all of my life, and this triggered that feeling. 

I got upset about that and kept asking what he could mean by that. I said he's a piece of shit who'd abandon his kids (I didn't say the piece of shit part but I wanted to). She kept arguing that I ""Didn't understand, he doesn't just mean physical, but mental fights as well"" like that makes anything better. I kept asking what any of that even means and said that was all bullshit and she kept repeating herself. So it escalated and I eventually gave up and shut the argument down.

The relationship was hanging by a thread at that point. The last straw was when I was on my first time on call at work. I was very nervous because I haven't done it before and never had to communicate with people like that. It was nearing the 4th of July so S asked me to take time off of on call to go to her brother's house for the party. 

I didn't know at the time that you could ask a coworker to switch with you, so I just told her ""I don't know if my dad (who's my boss) will allow that, but I'll check later and see what he says"" and then she said ""Well go check now"" and I said ""I will in a little bit"". 

Then she said ""No go check now because you won't"". I repeated what I said and she repeated again, then we kept on repeating and repeating. I eventually got fed up and told her to ""Stop bugging me about this"". Then she got angry and told me I'm ""Acting like a little kid"". Awhile after that I got a call and had my completely stressed mind preoccupied on that so I left her on read accidentially and when I got back home she had texted me to ""Never talk to her again and don't dare to go to her brother's house"". 

I told her I got called so I couldn't reply, and she told me ""if you won't get therapy this relationship won't last long"". I frantically tried to salvage the relationship so I agreed to go to therapy and to get into martial arts. The argument ended there and she thanked me.

But a day or two after that, she texted that she ""wanted to talk"" so I immediately knew what that meant and was filled with dread. She sent me the breakup text. I started begging, ""That was the last argument! I swear I'm going to get help, I'm sorry"" to which she said ""Stop saying you're sorry I hate when people say they're sorry, you just don't want to lose me"". 

That was correct. I told her I wanted to still be friends and she said ""It'll take awhile to trust you again but I think eventually we could be friends again"". But I didn't want to be friends, that was a desperate act to be with her again in any way. Right after the breakup, I just stared and dissociated for multiple minutes until I finally got up and told my mom. We went on vacation the week after, to Wyoming/Utah/Colorado. Great vacation.

I didn't want to tell anyone about the situation because I couldn't explain or wrap my head around it. She made me feel like I was the bad guy the whole time. I've had a couple years to wrap my head around it and now I know the reality of the situation is just very grey. I'm still angry about this, why did I have to go through relationship troubles all because everyone wants to treat me like trash, then I get blamed for it, told I'm just overreacting to everything?

I kept S in contact but a week or two after we broke up she had already put ""Taken"" on her Instagram. I don't know if it was real or not but that reaffirmed the feeling of being manipulated and played with by everybody, so I instantly blocked her and haven't heard from her since. 



Post-breakup, the desperation and yearning for a new relationship immediately surfaced again, and hasn't went away. Even almost two years later, I can't stop thinking about the past relationship, I still get dreams about her or her dad. Every girl I see that's even slightly attractive, I fantasize about having sex and being in a relationship with them. 

I wish I didn't view every girl with desires, but I can't get any of it out of my head. Whenever I find out a girl I'm interested in is already in a relationship, I get depressed. I'm depressed, lonely, and touch-starved every day. Every weekend I ruminate and cry, while holding myself, playing with my own hair, and hugging the pillow, wishing it was a person.

In the absense of connection with others, I have imagined the perfect friends, who always give me affection, who listen to all of my problems, who have similar values and minds as me. I don't get any of this with anybody I know. I feel disconnected from everyone. It feels like everybody is secretly plotting against me, like I'm in The Truman Show. Despite this, I still keep a side of hoping I'm wrong and a public act of seeming normal to everybody else.

I saw someone online talking about how they have a friend group that sleeps over together and cuddles to sleep every night. That story stuck with me, that is another aspect of the ""perfect friends"" I dream of. I wish I had that.

I had a dream of these friends once. It was us going on some type of adventure at some indescribable fantasy city. Every person there was made up, I've never seen them before, but one was familiar. 

There was a girl at my high school I was friends with because they were friends with someone I knew. I didn't know them much but when she killed herself, I cried and still to this day I imagine if she was still alive. I don't know why I care about her that much but I guess it's because she's the only one who asked how I was after a breakup. 

Nobody else even cared to ask how I was doing or of what happened, other than my mom, but she did. Why did one of the only people in my life who showed such care to me have to die?

I never get the opportunity to vent and tell my stories to anyone, and whenever I did, it always felt like they weren't actually listening. I don't just feel alone socially, but mentally, I have never seen or heard of anyone with issues particularly like mine, or viewpoints like mine. Is there nobody else like me in the world?



Going back in time a bit, I've heard about a lot of people who have suffered brain fog or some type of cognitive decline when COVID happened. This is relevant because I have suffered a bit of a decline as well. Not during COVID, I was actually doing better than ever when the pandemic happened, but nearing the end of high school, my mind just suddenly weakened.

My grades slipped and I barely graduated, my short-term memory tanked, and since graduating and especially since the last breakup, I have felt like I entered a different dimension. ""Reality"" since the pandemic feels like a simulation. I'm being kept prisoner in my mind, and in a world I don't recognize. My brain seems like an old computer with tons of malware. I don't process information correctly and it makes working difficult.

Not only does it seem like my mind is slowly rotting away, but physically I feel like I'm rotting away. Every time I've gotten sick since last year, I keep having Bronchitis attacks, coughing and gagging on mucas forever until I get medication for it. I don't know why this keeps happening to me. 

There's always red bumps (like bug bites or something) that pop up on my body and they'll stay for a long time. I don't have any bed bugs in the house so I have no idea where these bites come from.



I grew up on the internet since I was 10 years old back in 2013, using it for hours every day. Being on the internet for that long is an indescribable experience, you feel like you have lived another life concurrent with your normal life. Just recently, 11 years later, I have finally started to withdrawl from this addiction and have made steps to replace social media.

I think all the drama and failed relationships, as well as the years-long buildup of feeling a lack of connection with other people finally woke me up to start rethinking everything in my life. I always used the internet to make life more exciting, to have more connection with people, but it never gave me any connection. All of my internet life has been spent on scrolling, watching videos, and arguing with people. 

I never realized how toxic this all was until this year, when I would try to vent to people and to my ""friends"" about everything and would either be ignored or invalidated. I got tired of being ignored, constantly arguing with people online about stupid shit, and viewing brain rot ""content"". 

I deleted Twitter (I'm not calling it X, fuck off with that porn name, Elon) and Instagram. I used Reddit religiously and subbed to over a hundred subreddits but I cut it down to a few. The only reason I still use Reddit is because I'm big into Lostwave so I follow those communities but other than that I don't use it much. I mainly still use YouTube a lot which I'm trying to decrease. I watched a ton of commentary slop and political channels and I've cut those out and refined everything I watch.

If only I had those friends I dream of, I could finally gain the will to cut the internet out entirely. That's all hard to do when technology is all you have to make life worth living.",long story putting see anyone relate let know im alone elementary early high school bullied always tiny quiet white

1h98xih,2024-12-08T03:39:39,"Bored with life at 27. Is this just getting older? Or is it something more serious?
Never really posted on anything like this but I do feel like I need help. I look around my life and everything is pretty good. I‚Äôm happily married for almost 2 years, have good friends, a good job. A comfortable place to live and family who still loves and cares for me.

However most days I find myself questioning every decision I‚Äôve made in my life and just feeling bored and depressed with the routine. I go to work, come home, and make dinner. I watch football or basketball and kiss my wife goodnight. We take our dog for walks. Plans with friends or family every 6 weeks or so. I‚Äôm tired a lot. Things are good and I want it to be enough but I‚Äôm always hearing voices in my head telling me I‚Äôm wasting the peak years of my life. I love to cook and exercise but my wife has a lot of dietary restrictions and doesn‚Äôt enjoy exercising. Schedules never line up to do fun things with friends. Not very interested in doing some of the things I used to do. Finding myself sexually frustrated since I‚Äôve been with my wife since 19 but I feel like I‚Äôm in the best physical & sexual condition I‚Äôve ever been in. Constantly horny and sometimes thinking about other women. 

Just feel like I‚Äôm still at the bottom of the ladder of a life I‚Äôm not really interested in climbing, but things are so stable I feel ungrateful and scared when I consider starting over. Sometimes I‚Äôm not even sure if these thoughts are my actual own feelings or just depression knit picking at my life. Perhaps this is just what you have to deal with when you settle down, but I‚Äôm not sure if this is what I want to do for the next 30-40 years.

It‚Äôs driving me insane and I‚Äôm not sure if I can continue like this. Any advice would be helpful.

1h57ek7,2024-12-02T23:12:31,"I have NO idea what‚Äôs wrong with me 
Please take time to read this, I have no idea who to talk to.
I‚Äôm 18 and almost done with my first semester of college. Yet I am struggling in the weirdest ways, I have never cried so much before ever in my life. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôve always been an emotional and sentimental person but this is extreme and it‚Äôs mainly when I‚Äôm in college, away from home. I chose a college around 20 minutes away from my home since I know I am very close with my mother and sister and that moving further would be too painful, it has always been just the 3 of us at home, (im the older sibling). There‚Äôs other people who live really far from home yet they seem to be doing fine, they‚Äôre adapting and ready to move on in life and grow up. I feel like I‚Äôm suffocating every time I come back to my dorm. 

The thing is, I know that I am so extremely privileged to be able to get an education at a decent school and am so grateful that my parents agreed to help me pay, yet I feel so depressed here sometimes in ways that I really don‚Äôt want to be which makes me feel like a waste of space and shell of a person. I feel horrible for making people pay for me to experience what is supposed to be one of the best parts of your life yet being kind of miserable even though I‚Äôm trying so hard to see the good and have fun. I don‚Äôt party, but it‚Äôs just not my thing‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think that if I did it would change anything. I talk to people and have tried to put myself out there (despite still having social anxiety) and I barely have friends or genuine connections. Ultimately, I feel like a failure‚Ä¶ like I am living life wrong and I have no idea how to fix it or figure out what I should be doing and I am so painfully alone. I have always had times where I feel awful about myself and question everything about life in general but something about being at my dorm triggers it. 

My dorm is in a beautiful city that I do take time to explore during the day and during those moments I‚Äôm relatively okay‚Ä¶ then I get to the dorm and I feel like a dark shadow swallows me or something (excuse my dramatic-ness, I‚Äôm trying to paint a full picture of how I feel.) IMPORTANTLY, I miss my family to an extreme level that feels sick. I look at all the stuff that they have given me, that I brought from home and I start thinking about them nonstop and how I would choose being around them any day over being at this dorm. But I can‚Äôt be attached and depend on them forever, eventually my sister will also start her own life and I will be left alone. My mother questions why I‚Äôm so sad and I want to be strong and say that I am so f*cking happy to be in college but I have never been more lost and lonely and sentimental. I start crying over almost every little thing. I feel like a literal baby who can‚Äôt be away from home. I wanna be strong and grow up and whatever but I simply can‚Äôt. Sometimes I walk past people with their dogs and start tearing up thinking about mine. You‚Äôd think my entire family died or something. Seriously, I hate how sensitive I‚Äôve become. I keep thinking about growing up and getting older and growing farther from the people of your childhood and childhood itself. I just want to be a kid forever. I genuinely can‚Äôt see myself ever having my own house or life or anything, I can‚Äôt even be alone in a beautiful dorm without feeling absolutely empty and hopeless and aimless in life‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs actually wrong with me? I miss my family that lives legitimately 20 minutes away so much. I have intentionally held back on eating some of the food my mom bought me because I want to cherish it. Hell, I‚Äôm tearing up writing this. 

Life just feels like its full of so many hurdles and whatnot and right now I can‚Äôt even jump the first even though its literally only an inch high and I hate myself for this. I know that everyone has their own lives and struggles and that you cannot judge on what you see on the surface, yet they all seem so happy meanwhile I‚Äôm sad over seemingly nothing and being so stupid and childish making problems for myself. I can‚Äôt even think about the future and what cool things could be in store for me, I just think about the past and all the memories I have with the ones I love, I feel like I can‚Äôt so anything. I‚Äôve been depressed before and I don‚Äôt know if this is some weird form of depression but it all just feels so hopeless. Why am I one of the only sad people? Why am I so pathetic that all I think about is my mother at the grand age of 18. Sometimes when I distract myself and walk around and watch stuff and whatever I can be happy and sometimes my brain feels clear and I appreciate what I have a bit more. It‚Äôs not like life is hell all of the time. But it always crashes down since I‚Äôve been here. Whenever I wake up at home I‚Äôm fine but when I wake up here my heart is racing. Like actually, I feel like a defected fragment of a person who will never have anything going for myself. I‚Äôm so lost, like how am I going to manage myself? I‚Äôm an adult now‚Ä¶ what about when my parents die? The world is so big and I feel like an ant who anyone could step on. I‚Äôve never felt so sentimental and easy to break before. If you actually read this repetitive rant thank you. I‚Äôm just lost in life. I really don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me and if this will pass but it hasn‚Äôt. And I can‚Äôt keep going home and denying the adult-like and lonely future ahead of me. I want to go back in time and freeze it. It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs the end of the world and I‚Äôm a joke. I feel like I‚Äôm doing life wrong.

1h34t4q,2024-11-30T05:44:47,"I think I almost got close to crying on Thanksgiving.
For reference, the last time I cried was in 2011. It was either January or February. I was 13. I don't remember the month, but I know my birthday didn't come yet because I was going to turn 14 on March 6th. A Language Arts teacher I respected ridiculed me unprovoked. I felt betrayed, disrespected, and humiliated. So I cried. But more importantly, I felt weak. I felt so weak that I thought that I must never feel that way again. The next time I felt close to crying was the school year after when I was in an AP Human Geography because people in my second semester class would always tell me to shut up because they thought I was annoying. Even the teacher was annoyed by me asking questions. Only 4 people (3 girls and 1 boy) were nice to me. I felt devastated each day, but never cried. I did, however, just end up not speaking for the rest of the semester and failed the class.

To the main point of this post. It started during the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. When the Sesame Street float was on the screen, they played the song, ""Sing"" which is the one that goes like this:

Sing  
Sing a song  
Sing out loud  
Sing out strong  
Sing of good things, not bad  
Sing of happy, not sad  
Sing  
Sing a song  
Make it simple  
To last your whole life long  
Don't worry that it's not good enough  
For anyone else to hear  
Sing  
Sing a song

When I heard the ""Sing of happy, not sad"" part, that was when it hit me. I don't even know what it was. Maybe it is because I've been stressed out on things like getting into graduate school for the past 2 years since graduating in 2022 with a bachelor's and the overall feeling of feeling incomplete (especially considering it took too long to even get the bachelor's from 2015 to 2022 because incompetent school workers tried helping me and messed me up). Maybe it was other aspects in my life like having to deal with multiple deaths this year or the fact that I have dealt with many friends and people near my age dying since I was a freshman in high school. I don't know, but I felt this sudden feeling of intense sadness over a song that's supposed to be happy in nature. I know some people might say that it was just a nostalgia hit or something, but no; I had an overwhelming feeling of dread and sadness over a song that's supposed to be a happy song. I wasn't necessary longing for something because I didn't have the happiest childhood due to a sometimes abusive father, occasional issues with brothers and mother, and bullying in school. Or maybe I was sad because it caused me to think of said childhood because the Muppets and people on the float looked so happy. The ""Don't worry that it's not good enough"" part also hit me hard, probably because I've been feeling inadequate and incomplete for a while.

1h33xgr,2024-11-30T04:53:57,"Wow such great friends I have!
I have such great friends! I am getting so tired of this ungrateful and quite rude friends I seem to have accumulated. After all I do to help them they just ignore me when I clearly want someone to at least check on how I am feeling, for once. A little bit of background info on what‚Äôs going on, I am going through a lot for a very long time and I just want to get away from it but if I even think of telling a ‚Äòtrusted adult‚Äô or just someone who can do something I am threatened? Like what type of reaction is that to someone trying to ask for just a little advice!

I am going to split this into section before I start to rant about life and say a little too much.

My friends rn are all in a group chat which I made so we can have a big community of people that is able to help one another. But to be frank it seems the others aren‚Äôt that interested in being caring at all they always give half- responses or just an ‚Äúok sorry‚Äù pretty much just makes it worse for mental wounds and I know none of the people in this group chat are perfectly fine. Some of them don‚Äôt talk in the chat anymore. But the thing that really angers me is how much I put into everyone, I tell when I‚Äôm not going to be able to respond to them, they even go to me with their problems, and after doing so much to make it a safe place for everyone in the chat. I am just mad rn because I do everything to help them, I make time for them, and it costs me so much I could get in serious trouble with my school or parents if I end up being called because someone want to talk at a awful time and I forgot to say something. A lot of these friends I am upset with aren‚Äôt even my age, and they are older and have much more life experience then me but it seems as tho I am the only person with responsibility? I kinda hope one of them sees this just so they can finally understand how much I put into them. I feel betrayed but Ik that‚Äôs the wrong word but it just hurts to know that you will put everything on the line to just help one person you don‚Äôt know that well just to see them happy, but they won‚Äôt even acknowledge you when your feeling ‚Äúbad‚Äù. It hurts. 

They don‚Äôt know this, well maybe a few friends know about my past, but it not like I won‚Äôt talk about it they just have to ask. I have always been having relative ‚Äúproblems‚Äù ever since I can remember. Do you know what that can do to a person? I am still dealing with it but slightly different now. But it still involves my relatives. One of my friends were literally dealing with the same thing but for a shorter period of time but worse behavior. I just hoped that maybe I could have gotten a little ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù or maybe a ‚ÄúWanna talk about it?‚Äù but no I was just ignored and sure it wasn‚Äôt about the relative issues but it was still something that was bothering me. It‚Äôs not that much just every time I think about working on a video like for Instagram pre YouTube I start to tremble as if I‚Äôm scared to start making it, and how not being creative as an artist has been taking a toll on my mental health.

No I can‚Äôt talk to much people about this because as I said I get threatened when I do, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs intended to be that way, or it can also just be straight out rude things to say to someone trying to express something around you. Why can‚Äôt people be a little bit more empathetic when someone‚Äôs trying to express hardship? I have so many questions. Why do I laugh when in pain or sad? Or why do I cry when mad? It doesn‚Äôt add up. If I am nice to you for a very long time don‚Äôt you feel at least a little remorse for me? I don‚Äôt spect much I just want someone who cares for me enough to ask how my day was and for me to be able to answer with a true statement not just ‚Äúfine/good‚Äù. Maybe it stems from something else I don‚Äôt quite know. 

Thanks for reading this ‚Äúvent‚Äù(?) I just had to get it out because if I keep bottling it, and pushing is down I might start getting worse and can‚Äôt help anyone. I like being their for people, as weird as it sounds I want to hear others pain and I want to be there to listen. I feel as though I have became that person but at what cost? My own health? Why can‚Äôt I just be able to help others and have that same person for me? Is that really fair for me and others that do the same thing or as a coping mechanism.",wow great friends great friends getting tired ungrateful quite rude friends seem accumulated help ignore clearly want someone least check feeling little bit background info whats going going lot long time want get away even think telling trusted adult someone something threatened like type reaction someone trying ask little advice going split section start rant life say little much friends rn group chat made big community people able help one another frank seems others arent interested caring always give half responses ok sorry pretty much makes worse mental wounds know none people group chat perfectly fine dont talk chat anymore thing really angers much put everyone tell im going able respond even go problems much make safe place everyone chat mad rn everything help make time costs much could get serious trouble school parents end called someone want talk awful time forgot say something lot friends upset arent even age older much life experience seems tho person responsibility kinda hope one sees finally understand much put feel betrayed ik thats wrong word hurts know put everything line help one person dont know well see happy wont even acknowledge feeling bad hurts dont know well maybe friends know past like wont talk ask always relative problems ever since remember know person still dealing slightly different still involves relatives one friends literally dealing thing shorter period time worse behavior hoped maybe could gotten little okay maybe wanna talk ignored sure wasnt relative issues still something bothering much every time think working video like instagram pre youtube start tremble im scared start making creative artist taking toll mental health cant talk much people said get threatened dont think intended way also straight rude things say someone trying express something around cant people little bit empathetic someones trying express hardship many questions laugh pain sad cry mad doesnt add nice long time dont feel least little remorse dont spect much want someone cares enough ask day able answer true statement finegood maybe stems something else dont quite know thanks reading vent get keep bottling pushing might start getting worse cant help anyone like people weird sounds want hear others pain want listen feel though became person cost health cant able help others person really fair others thing coping mechanism,1,3,0,Neutral,Low,[],[]

1gpyn7i,2024-11-13T00:22:07,"Anxiety/student/Triggering Spaces 
I‚Äôm a second year university student and I‚Äôve struggled with anxiety ever since I was a child. My anxiety peeked after Covid due to personal circumstances and I found it hard to adjust to the world after months of lockdown. I then started sixth form and my anxiety and shyness became worse, I made no new friends and the pressure to study and continue being the best occupied my life for 2 years. 

I then started uni and thought I was doing better but yet again I struggled to make friends and found anxiety taking over my life. I continued studying hard and that distracted me for some time until summer. 

I had the worse summer of my life, filled with anxiety, worry, guilt and just pure fear because I didn‚Äôt get the exact grades I wanted, I got a work experience purely through connections which filled me with this guilt. I couldn‚Äôt relax even when I went on holiday and barely ate the whole time I was there. I also started having these intense panic attacks which led to another fear- I woke up everyday scared another attack was coming. 

Once I got back to uni again I thought things would get better because I‚Äôd get busy again and could focus on studying. But there hasn‚Äôt been a day since this summer where I haven‚Äôt felt physically sick from anxiety and worry. And this is all because I‚Äôm so terrified of the future. I‚Äôve put myself under this pressure to get a training contract by 3rd year and start working because of if I don‚Äôt I‚Äôm a massive failure. I constantly feel like time is running out and whatever reassurance I try give myself fails miserably. 

And because of that horrible summer I have started to associate all those horrible things I felt with where I felt them most‚Ä¶ at home. 

I‚Äôve come back home just for 2 days for the first time since summer and I was excited to come back and see my family. And then ever since I got here I‚Äôve been holding back tears. I feel so anxious when I‚Äôm here and I feel terrible because this is supposed to be my home with my family. But I want to go back to my room at uni desperately, that‚Äôs the only place where I can feel anxious and it doesn‚Äôt get too overwhelming because I know I‚Äôm by myself and I‚Äôm safe. 

I don‚Äôt really know what this is or why I‚Äôm writing this but I feel so lost. I don‚Äôt know how to slow down and I don‚Äôt want to be afraid to come back to my own home.

Hey GC's

I'm a 42yo, divorced with 2 kids I see them 5 days a fortnight.

I've always been told that ""you're not good enough"" or ""you're doing every wrong"" from family.  Didn't get the comfort or support my family or partners

I was sexually abused at 5 and didn't have anyone to go to and when I brought it up later in life it was dismissed

Hell even when I was about to get married my mum wasn't going to attend (I only had 3 people on my side to see me get married while my ex had bout 40+)

Growing up and in my last marriage I saw what families are like and if I am honest it makes me upset that I never had that and I still don't as they only reach out when they want something.

Yes I have a lot of trauma and probably undiagnosed ADHD or autism (1 kid with ADHD and other with high functioning autism) and been in and out of mental health services all my life.  I'm at the point where even when someone says something that is meant to be funny it triggers me and makes me really upset

I always have to reach out to people for any social activities and never asked to attend social gatherings.

I am always told to harden up and just think happy thoughts...

1fs1snv,2024-09-29T12:59:46,"Reached out to my high school bully for my healing journey.
Today, I reached out to my high school bully, an upperclassman. I left him this message:  
  
`Hi Kuya. I'm doing this because I need closure. I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 disorder in 2013. This is a mental health problem that causes mania and depression with psychosis. This year I found out I was misdiagnosed. With the help of my current psychiatrist, I found out I have schizoaffective disorder bipolar type. You're probably wondering why this concerns you. Here's why. I developed a thing I call a ""laughter episode"" and here's the part where you come in. When I entered our school, I was sure of myself. I knew I stood out because I only wore black and was counter-culture. I was brought up in a loving environment and being away from family was tough. But I soldiered on. A batchmate of mine, I won't say who, told me that you were laughing at me behind my back. I don't know who else in your batch. ""Si *Violet may balbas."" Hearing that broke my heart. I never told anyone about it. It made me feel unpretty. I was also ashamed to tell anyone. Since then, that kid was never the same again. Did you know *Clark tried to court me in third year but I told him to fuck off because I thought he was just fucking with me? My self-esteem was that low. The most popular guy in the batch wanted me but I didn't believe him. When were in fourth year, he still pursued me and he was my first kiss. Turns out he really liked me. When I was in college after parting ways with *Clark, I still saw myself unworthy of love. I never had an actual relationship in college. I only had my first this year and it ended this week. I remember the school-wide group event stint where you were the leader you did on me to humiliate me. The drawing of moustache. I think you intentionally chose our costume to be a devil so you can draw a moustache on me. You were very cruel. I've been on therapy since 2013 when I was diagnosed. You're not the reason for my illness. There are tons of factors why I have this. That specific trauma you caused though made my diagnosis change. Every time I go in a public place and I hear people laughing, I assume they're laughing because of me. I try to shake it off and convince myself hard that they don't. If that doesn't work, I leave the place immediately or wear headphones. If the psychosis is present without a mood disturbance, you're a schizoaffective. I'm now categorized as that since I'm no longer depressed. I'm not doing this to make you feel bad. I'm doing this as a part of my healing journey. I forgive you. I genuinely feel beautiful now. I only started feeling it in my 30s. I also plan to get laser treatment soon. I can afford to anyway. No need to be shamed and shave my upper lip myself. I hope you say sorry to other schoolmates you bullied directly or indirectly in high school. All the people you've wronged when we were stupid kids. Imagine if that happens to your kids in the future. Don't be cruel. Always choose kindness. I think I'll end this here. A weight was lifted off my chest.`

He still hasn't replied and I don't know what he'll say but I feel better. It probably won't stop the psychosis because my brain is wired differently now but this step is essential for me to move on. I've forgiven him. When I first told people about what he did to me and how he affected me, they saw him as a monster. There was time when I was so mad at him because I realized how much of a jerk he was. But now I'm letting go. I'll find my peace soon.  
  
To anyone who struggle with mental health problems reading this, please soldier on. I know we fight an uphill battle but please have hope in your heart. Hope is a powerful thing. A little spark can ignite into something great. I may not know you, but I love you and you will make it through.

1fqamsy,2024-09-27T01:54:50,"Incompetent PSYC NP Caused My Personal Experience in Hell
I was on a bunch of medications that had major interactions and I literally needed to go to the mental hospital inpatient because 1. I was suicidal due to all the medications that were fighting each other. And 2. I was so addicted to the high dose, high potency benzos she had me on plus other medication that was extremely hard to kick. So please, take my story and make sure you aren‚Äôt getting snowed by a provider you think is trying to help. I will answer any questions and will be happy to help anyone else with their journey! 

Either way, here is my list from when I entered the mental hospital and please feel free to comment and interact. I would love to communicate! Here it goes. 

And one more thing, I am certain about the doses. They may seem ridiculous but I assure you these are all correct meds and dosages. Thank you for the read! 

1. Clonazepam (Klonopin) 2mg three times daily

2. Alprazolam (Xanax) 1mg twice daily as needed. 

3. Venlafaxine ER (Effexor XR) 225mg once every AM. 

4. Bupropion SR (Wellbutrin SR) 400mg once every AM. 

5. Hydroxyzine (Atarax) 100mg three times daily. 

6. Trazodone (Desyrel) 100mg at once at bedtime PM. 

7. Gabapentin (Neurontin) 600mg three times daily. 

8. Divalproex (Depakote) 500 mg twice daily. 

9. Lithium Carbonate ER 450mg twice daily. 

10. Olanzapine (Zyprexa) 15mg at bedtime. 

11. Quetiapine ER (Seroquel XR) 100mg at bedtime. 

Just to put this into better perspective as well, I was 18-19 while being treated by this woman with the diagnosis being fresh as well. This was about a year ago. In October of 2023, was when I entered the mental hospital due to this combination. 

Here are the meds that I came out of the mental hospital with (I have an even better group of meds now) and felt 10x more animated and myself. I didn‚Äôt feel like a zombie for the first time in 6-8 months. 

1. Venlafaxine ER (Effexor XR) 75 mg once daily in the AM. 

2. Hydroxyzine (Atarax) 50 mg every 4-6 hours as needed. 

3. Trazodone (Desyrel) 100mg once daily at bedtime. 

4. Gabapentin (Neurontin) 300mg three times daily. 

5. Quetiapine ER (Seroquel XR) 100 mg at bedtime. 

6. Lurasidone (Latuda) 40 mg once daily at dinner time. 

7. Alprazolam (Xanax) 1mg twice daily as needed.

I also have a different medication list now, so if anyone is interested in seeing that as well please let me know!

Plus im really really hate going to the er as that is the protocol before being hospitalized in a facility. Also if at any time you state you wont hurt yourself they let you go. Which is dangerous because i usually lie. Also you end up in a cot with like 5 other people eiter just as crazy as you or sometimes yelling or on drugs freaking out with nothing to do for like 3 or more days. You cant walk around you have to stay on rhe cot basically the whole time and they wont give you your psych meds so you get sick from withdrawl its terrible. I would rater be in a coma. Which is why hurting myself is so appealing. I just dont want to have these thought. I also cant cry at all im both numb and hurting at the same time. Its making me crazy.

1f960r8,2024-09-05T00:04:51,"My Life has been getting worse everyday
Hello World. this is ny first time posting here, and i want to introduce myself.

my name is luke. im currently 19 and from pennsylvania. everyday has been getting worse and worse and im losing hope in my life. if im gonna be honest, it started the day i was born. 

my earliest memory however was when i was 3 years old. Sharktale was on the TV when the worm at the beginning of the movie was screaming all up close and shit. now, any other child might find it funny but for me, it traumatized me deeply. my mother and sister thought my reaction was ""funny"" and replayed it over and over until it was engraved into my head. i consider this moment the start of my trauma as i constantly had nightmares up until i was 7 years old.

once i was 11 years old, i was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. this came at a time where i was constantly bullied, harassed, and tormented by students in elementary school. middle school wasn't easier, as the classes i was in for autism students were for ""really low functioning"" kids, and i was better than that. i was bullied a bit as well in middle school and it continued into high school.

for high school, i learned absolutely nothing, was bullied by both students and staff, and i had constant paranoia, anxiety, and depression. once i graduated high school, i was on my way to college.

my whole life was based off this lie. a lie that college would be easier than high school and people would be more humane. when i got to west chester university, i was treated like trash. my roommate would swap rooms on me over a room divider, leaving me isolated and alone. one ""friend"" group i really hated was just flat out toxic and always threw me to the side. it only got worse.

on November 11th, 2023, i responded about someone that i thought wasnt a real account because for some reason on the public college story, they ended up blocking me. they then responded back with a false accusation of sexual harassment, and the whole school found out. i was made a laughing stock, i was made a meme, i was made to fucking suffer. it gotten so bad that i was literally feet away from diving head first off of the highest point of the parking garage. sometimes, i wish i had done it that day. i wish i had jumped off and ended it all.

i was even forced to dropout because of all the chaos. i got a job right after dropping out, but they treated me poorly. i then got a painting job for 4 months but they then fired me. my life has been nothing but trash. i got no friends, no job, no money, no girlfriend, and life just gets worse as time goes on. my mental health has really got worse and theres no going back. i just want to end my life and say goodbye. i think my time is up.

You know what I learned over time, like especially in high school where you learn a lot . . Like, to give you context- I am a helpful person, I feel joy when my friend comes to me for a problem and I try to help them with it. This is like, outside of like school problems and more so personal ones. The crazy thing is when I need help, (I have PTSD, anxiety, and daddy issues) people never really focus on me and what I need. And I started to tell myself like- ""People don't give a damn about you, it's what you can do for them that counts."" and it had been my main saying for a couple of years now.

  
The thing is I'm feeling way better, I've been into healing and keeping my space. . . . Now it feels like I'm in this little ""era"" of not giving a fuck and I have been enjoying it so far. But then there is this other part of me that wants to be mindful, ""What if people hate me for it? This is kinda selfish. . ."" and so on. Kinda like self sabotage, and I'm really enjoying this carefree feeling. I was so critical of myself in the past, I hated how I looked, acted, and even the way I dressed. I always thought I was bummy.

  
The funniest thing is that I feel so isolated from other people, I can get awkward and sometimes I feel like I come across as standoffish, sometimes I just don't wanna talk but I wanna have better social skills. Like that feeling of normalcy that I have been yearning for all these damn years is finally given. But damn, it has really been a while. . .

I go to my room to cry. Meanwhile she told me to go fix the TV. (I am still very upset, but I still fix it).

1f0vo01,2024-08-25T14:54:11,"32M feeling lost in life
I am a 32 years old unmarried, childless man and I am currently feeling lost in life. Therefore, and facing some embarrassment at first, I picked up the courage to seek professional support from a therapist for the first time in my life. Nonetheless, I've decided to post here in order to get additional advice from this community.

I think that my current feeling of being lost (or left behind) in life mainly stems from two circumstances: mild bullying which resulted in the inability to fully experience my teenage years if and when I compare them with the ones experienced by my peers and the loss of my father due to cancer when Covid-19 was ravaging in 2020. The first circumstance, in fact, turned me from a quite extroverted and carefree boy into an introverted, overthinking and resentful man while the second one wreaked havoc in my everyday life as I abruptly lost one of the most important people I was attached to in a phase in which everyone is supposed to settle down both personally and professionally. Cancer is basically like having to deal with a time bomb where you cannot see the timer and this puts you face to face with the precariousness of life.

Those events profoundly affected me, as I practically spent my teenage years most of the time alone focusing on my studies and these last years trying to settle down professionally facing great difficulties in both dealing with people (as I work in Sales & Distribution) and life itself. There are days in which I feel completely absorbed by what I am doing and therefore I manage to get things done as expected without having to deal with what my therapist calls ""intrusive thoughts"" and others in which I feel overwhelmed by a hurricane of negative thoughts and sensations about myself and the future ahead of me that make me cry silently on my pillow as soon as I get home at the end of the day.

I deeply regret the fact of not having been able to experience love in its blossoming, intense and raw nature during my teenage years, unlike my peers, the fact that those times and hangouts will never come back again thus leaving a deep scar inside my heart and lastly, the fact that I am very often going to be at unease in social settings when acquaintances/colleagues etc. discuss about their family, children and career prospects. At the same time I also drastically reduced the amount of time I spend on social media as people just seem to share the good things in their lives, but I always try to take any opportunity to hang around my friends and family members, even if some of them are starting a family and this makes me feel at unease as I previously explained. Going out for dinner/ a movie/ a play at the theatre all by myself is too much for me to handle and, quite frankly, humiliating at the moment. Casually going out for some drinks or travelling instead, are more manageable activities but come with some strain as well.

I'd like to become more optimistic and resilient in order not to find myself alone and hopeless as I reach maturity and retirement. What advice would you give me? Thank you for your help and please forgive me if I made some mistakes but I am not a native English speaker.",32m feeling lost life 32 years old unmarried childless man currently feeling lost life therefore facing embarrassment first picked courage seek professional support therapist first time life nonetheless ive decided post order get additional advice community think current feeling lost left behind life mainly stems two circumstances mild bullying resulted inability fully experience teenage years compare ones experienced peers loss father due cancer covid19 ravaging 2020 first circumstance fact turned quite extroverted carefree boy introverted overthinking resentful man second one wreaked havoc everyday life abruptly lost one important people attached phase everyone supposed settle personally professionally cancer basically like deal time bomb cannot see timer puts face face precariousness life events profoundly affected practically spent teenage years time alone focusing studies last years trying settle professionally facing great difficulties dealing people work sales distribution life days feel completely absorbed therefore manage get things done expected without deal therapist calls intrusive thoughts others feel overwhelmed hurricane negative thoughts sensations future ahead make cry silently pillow soon get home end day deeply regret fact able experience love blossoming intense raw nature teenage years unlike peers fact times hangouts never come back thus leaving deep scar inside heart lastly fact often going unease social settings acquaintancescolleagues etc discuss family children career prospects time also drastically reduced amount time spend social media people seem share good things lives always try take opportunity hang around friends family members even starting family makes feel unease previously explained going dinner movie play theatre much handle quite frankly humiliating moment casually going drinks travelling instead manageable activities come strain well id like become optimistic resilient order find alone hopeless reach maturity retirement advice would give thank help please forgive made mistakes native english speaker,3,2,0,Neutral,Low,[],[]

It's really hard to put into words how I feel. I just got home from work, where I was so miserable my entire shift that the last half hour I had to hold back tears and hide the fact I was crying even though I just work a shitty retail job and I just got back from being gone for two weeks. What makes it even better is that I haven't gone to work sober for more than a few days in years because of how much I loathe working anywhere. I already hate being in crowded places or social sotuations, thanks autism and ADHD, but also I know I sound like a lazy piece of shit but knowing Ill probably be working shitty meaningless jobs for the rest of my life is awful. I've always had very bad depression since I was a kid but it's getting close to feeling unbearable. I really want to call out of work tomorrow, but I can't afford to miss the hours even though I want to scream and rip my hair out half the time I'm there. I really want to be alone but I live with my partner who I know is going to want to support me but honestly I just want be alone so I can get black out drunk and just go numb again. I drink or smoke a shit ton of weed everyday and most of the time I don't even feel good anymore, it just makes me feel neutral which is preferable to being sober. It's hard to see a way out. Honestly being with my partner is making me feel bad, before I had any strong connections it was easy to think momento mori and other fun suicidal thoughts but now I can't even think about that without feeling how guilty I'd feel for devastating my partner with my death. I know they wouldn't be able to get over it for years with how close we are but I can't share this burden with them. They have their own issues and going to them about how suicidal I've been I fear will terrify them and be beyond their ability to help.

1ekduhu,2024-08-05T05:25:32,"Shattered Mirrors 
Have you ever heard the phrase the abused becomes the abused becomes the abused ? Well let me tell you there is some truth to that . With this post I‚Äôm going to live in my truth. When I was around 8 or 9 I was sexually molested by girl who was pretty much like a child hood friend of mine and she was around 10 or 11. Every since I was young and even up till now at the age of 22 I have always been described and labeled by my family as Gullible and as an adult now I can honestly say that they were right. Whenever the girl would come over my house she would get me to engage in touching each other in sexual ways she would often touch on me first and then she would persuade me into touching her and i honestly didn‚Äôt know what was going on but because this was happening to me I started getting strong erections and at that age you don‚Äôt know how to even navigate something like that. This childhood friend of mine came over my house a lot she spent a few Christmases with us she even went on a vacation with me and my family once so with that being she had been touching me a lot . This form of abuse left me really hyper sexual and I ended doing the exact same thing that happened to me to my younger brother and now at the age of 22 years old I deeply regret what I did to him and even though me and my brother have a great relationship today I honestly feel like I will forever hate myself for doing that to him when I was little. After the incident between me and my brother happened I got introduced to pornography around the ages of 10 and 12 and I developed a really really bad porn addiction that I struggle with right now today. When I got to high school when I was 14 a girl that was around 18 started liking me and at first I knew nothing about relationships or girls and most of the girls who were in my grade with me rejected me and didn‚Äôt think of me or view me as someone who was attractive and a potential boyfriend. Later down the line I got comfortable with her and I leaned into it so me and this girl would often talk to each other every day at school and hang out but we ended up breaking up. It wasn‚Äôt until later on that I found out that I basically got groomed by that girl and the word groomed at that time was new to me but the damage had already been done. When me and that girl finally stopped talking in high school I spent most of my 9th and 10th grade year of high school single, socially awkward , insecure and not having any success with any of the girls in my grade. Now you‚Äôre probably wondering why i didn‚Äôt tell my mom about what happens to me when I was a kid well every since I was a kid and a teenager i unfortunately suffered physical, verbal and emotional abuse from my own mother which caused me to develop a lying problem because I was afraid of having conflict with her and I was afraid if I told her what happened to me when I was kid I would have gotten punished by her instead. In my 11th and 12th grade year my loneliness grew stronger so between those two years of my high school career I decided to come out of my comfort zone and just see what happens if i started talking to girls and that‚Äôs exactly what I did except the girls that i had talked to so happened to be a year or 2 younger than me so at the age of 18 I found myself talking to some girls that were between the ages of 15 to 17 . I ended up loosing my virginity to a girl that was a year younger than me but that relationship didn‚Äôt last long. The more I think about it now I hate myself because I feel like I had betrayed my inner child because I allowed that 18 year old girl to talk to me when I was 14 and I feel like I betrayed him even more when I decided to talk to younger girls when I was in high school. That time in high school I felt trapped it always seemed like I was only good enough for girls who were younger than me but came up short when i tried to get a girl my age to like me which made me think something was wrong with me . When I was 18 19 and 20 i still found myself talking to and being attracted to younger girls and as bad as this sounds I can say I do have an attraction towards girls who are 16 and 17 but I do not like the fact that I am attracted to them. When I was 21 I had my old bus driver‚Äôs 15 year old gay son text me and basically tell me he had feelings for me and that he wanted to do sexual things with me and I told him that we shouldn‚Äôt do that and i blocked him afterwards and I‚Äôve never had sexual contact with any of the younger people I talked to I never tried to meet up with them and be sexual with them , so I guess that‚Äôs one good thing that can be taken away from this post . I am in fact attracted to people my age so I‚Äôm sorry for the confusion but anyways I‚Äôve had sexual encounters now between the ages between 21 and 22 and they have all been with girls who are my age i just don‚Äôt like the fact that I have attraction towards younger people as well ,and i don‚Äôt how much I hate I will get for making this post but writing this and getting this off my chest has made me feel better. Now all I want is help professionally from a therapist but I‚Äôm afraid to tell a therapist any of this because I‚Äôm afraid of being view as a crazy person and being reported by them and porn has been an escape for me but it‚Äôs honestly making my mental health worse. If I had the chance to go back in time and prevent this from happening to me when I was a kid then I probably would be living a happy and healthy life right now but hopefully it‚Äôs not too late for me to do that .",shattered mirrors ever heard phrase abused becomes abused becomes abused well let tell truth post im going live truth around 8 9 sexually molested girl pretty much like child hood friend mine around 10 11 every since young even till age 22 always described labeled family gullible adult honestly say right whenever girl would come house would get engage touching sexual ways would often touch first would persuade touching honestly didnt know going happening started getting strong erections age dont know even navigate something like childhood friend mine came house lot spent christmases us even went vacation family touching lot form abuse left really hyper sexual ended exact thing happened younger brother age 22 years old deeply regret even though brother great relationship today honestly feel like forever hate little incident brother happened got introduced pornography around ages 10 12 developed really really bad porn addiction struggle right today got high school 14 girl around 18 started liking first knew nothing relationships girls girls grade rejected didnt think view someone attractive potential boyfriend later line got comfortable leaned girl would often talk every day school hang ended breaking wasnt later found basically got groomed girl word groomed time new damage already done girl finally stopped talking high school spent 9th 10th grade year high school single socially awkward insecure success girls grade youre probably wondering didnt tell mom happens kid well every since kid teenager unfortunately suffered physical verbal emotional abuse mother caused develop lying problem afraid conflict afraid told happened kid would gotten punished instead 11th 12th grade year loneliness grew stronger two years high school career decided come comfort zone see happens started talking girls thats exactly except girls talked happened year 2 younger age 18 found talking girls ages 15 17 ended loosing virginity girl year younger relationship didnt last long think hate feel like betrayed inner child allowed 18 year old girl talk 14 feel like betrayed even decided talk younger girls high school time high school felt trapped always seemed like good enough girls younger came short tried get girl age like made think something wrong 18 19 20 still found talking attracted younger girls bad sounds say attraction towards girls 16 17 like fact attracted 21 old bus drivers 15 year old gay son text basically tell feelings wanted sexual things told shouldnt blocked afterwards ive never sexual contact younger people talked never tried meet sexual guess thats one good thing taken away post fact attracted people age im sorry confusion anyways ive sexual encounters ages 21 22 girls age dont like fact attraction towards younger people well dont much hate get making post writing getting chest made feel better want help professionally therapist im afraid tell therapist im afraid view crazy person reported porn escape honestly making mental health worse chance go back time prevent happening kid probably would living happy healthy life right hopefully late,2,0,0,Neutral,Low,[],[]
1ejd64e,2024-08-03T22:31:16,"Have an unhealthy obsession with someone and I want to die, how do I move on and forget about her
Throwaway account for a reason as this is going to make me sound like a stalker

I have this werid attachment/obession with this girl i fell out with 

For some context we met about a year ago on a college trip abroad (college is the uk equivalent to high school for the americans here)

And me and her were pretty much instant freinds and we clicked really well with each other 
Pretty much inseperable throughout the trip 
As time went on I developed romantic feelings for her
And for some more context, at that point in my life, i had never had a female freind, or any attention from the opposite sex, so the attention she gave me, even though it wasnt anything romantic, i fell hard, more than anything i had ever imagined possible 

When the trip had ended we stayed in conact and eventually after i worked up the confidence to message her, we started hanging out and doing activties together 
We both really had fun hanging out with each other 
And my feelings grew and grew until i eventually developed an emotional attatchment to her, and i didnt even realise that at the time, i just thought it was a normal crush

At some point i decided i was going to pursue her romanticly 
Eventually she asked me if i liked her, which i responded to ""to be honest you are not wrong, im sorry if that makes you uncomfortable""

To shorten the big paragrah she sent me, she basicly said she wasnt looking for a relationship 

I was understandably, heart broken 
She wanted to stay freinds, which i agreed too 
Only problem with that is that i still had feelings for her and for a long time i held onto hope that she would change her mind about me, but she never saw me in any way other than a freind 

And i just kept overthinking the situaton and kept hurting myself mentally, i felt like there was somthing wrong with me, and i was obsessing over why she didnt like me and what was wrong with me

At some point i said that we should part ways because i kept getting hurt every time we hung out cuss i knew i couldnt ever be anything more than a freind 
For about a week i tried getting over her 
And if you know anything about healing, its that its not a journey with a straight path, one day youll feel invincble, the next you feel like there's no hope for you

And i had one of these days where i felt invincible, so i decided to get back in conact with her 
And she enthusasticly agreed and we became really close freinds, when she went through personal problems i was there for her 

When i was stuggling with my own mental health, she was there for me 

However, without me knowing at first, i still had feelings and that same emotional attachment to her and when i did realise i did, i was scared and tried convincing myself otherwise

Eventually after she was listening to some of my insecurities (which were to do with relationships and love and all that) she figuired out that i still liked her 
And she was worried that she may give me the wrong idea and lead me on and she said to me she needed space

And due to that emotional attachment and also a lot of anxitey i had i felt like she was abandoing me and that she hated me and that all i did was annoy her, and i ended up blaming her for it and trying to twist thing to make her seem like she was in the wrong
So we fell out and we parted ways again 
After some time i realised what i did and how i acted 
I felt guilty that i ruined the freindship 
I got in conact with her again to appologise for everthing 
She did forgive me which was nice but she didnt want to be freinds again 

And it hurt but i cant blame her
However dispite all this i still feel an emotional attachmet to her 

And i want her back more than anything 

And i dont like to admit this but i had been stalking her online through looking at her works instgram account and through her public account which i look at via chrome without an account because she has me blocked
And i see shes doing really well in life and i hate how because of my own stupid fucking actions that i wont be around for that
I miss her

And i need help moving on 
I find it extremely difficult to not look her up or to try to not give myself an insight into her life

Im obsessed with her and its not healthy at all 
And with the combination other problems ive had going on i have been feeling like killing myself

I dont want to die but i dont want to live with this obsession anymore and death feels like an escape

1ehp53b,2024-08-01T21:15:38,"Been overthinking and I wish I could stop
I really don‚Äôt know what to do about this. I‚Äôm diagnosed with autism and OCD. I don‚Äôt really know if it‚Äôs the OCD driving my thoughts, at the very least I think it‚Äôs a big part of it. 

I can‚Äôt stop questioning myself. I feel a lack of identity inside, I have for a long time, and I‚Äôve always been driven to discover my ‚Äúauthentic self‚Äù, as if it exists outside of me. 

I tend to go into spirals trying to figure it out. Honestly I‚Äôve been in one for months now, I think it‚Äôs one of the worst I‚Äôve experienced. I‚Äôve been researching personality disorders. I honestly found I was seeing myself in them, but it‚Äôs difficult for me to know if I *actually* experience the symptoms or if the symptoms are derivative of something else and I‚Äôm just exaggerating in my head. I know the solution probably is ‚Äújust stop, take a break‚Äù, but it really is a bit obsessive. I‚Äôm analyzing every single action, every word I say, thought I have, and questioning it. Nothing is *ever* conclusive to me. I mean, I even thought that this was the OCD but my bf was telling me how he‚Äôs been like this when in an identity crisis and I‚Äôm not even sure about *that*. And then I start to question again and have to figure it all out once more. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs the OCD. 

Honestly my main ponderings have been over narcissism (PD or traits), but tbh that‚Äôs not that uncommon a theme in OCD. Every emotion and motivation I have I have to question it. ‚ÄúIs this empathy? Do I experience affective empathy? Can you be compassionate without affective empathy? What if being compassionate is just self serving and all I want is praise? Doesn‚Äôt everyone want a thank you? Am I doing things just for myself? Doesn‚Äôt everyone act in self motivation? Doesn‚Äôt everyone have fantasies of success? Doesn‚Äôt everyone want attention? What if I‚Äôm just attention starved? Am I attention starved or do I need this to function?‚Äù

That‚Äôs like maybe 0.001% of it all. I‚Äôve been writing long analyses of myself and doing a lot of research and reading personal experiences from people to try and compare myself to. But then even doing that makes me question my motives, and I only comparing myself to others because I‚Äôm a narcissist? 

I‚Äôve found ways to justify all of it. And honestly I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if I at least have narcissistic traits, simply because I suspect my mom of narcissism. It‚Äôs not like I care whether or not I‚Äôm a narcissist it‚Äôs only pop psyche that‚Äôs made them out to be villainous monsters when really they can just be a damn normal human being. The part that stresses me out so much is the *not knowing* of whether my actions and motivations are narcissism, normal things everyone experiences just by the merits of being a living human being, if it‚Äôs stuff like autism+DPDR, or what. I wish I could just stop questioning myself and just live life as I always have, but the thoughts just *won‚Äôt* go away. My mind is suffering. 

I do find answering my questions relieving to a degree, but then I just get more questions, and the ones I‚Äôve answered still are never conclusive so I still mull them over constantly until the next bout of relief. Narcissism or something else entirely, I at least am feeling seen for‚Ä¶ not being quite right. Trying to figure out empathy has been a huge thing for me, because I‚Äôve always struggled with connecting with people and comforting them even if I have the desires to *want* to connect. I at the very least like seeing such a spectrum of ways to experience social and emotional connection. I‚Äôve always hated having friends, it makes me insanely anxious and I‚Äôm always afraid they‚Äôll come to me seeking comfort because I just can‚Äôt do that. My inability made me rather depressed throughout school, but I think I was just trying to do something that it seemed like other people could do and I was just failing and I felt guilty over it.

I'm writing this hear as  I want confess a fear. I have lots of friends (people i know and talk to regularly who don't live close). I have a wonderful girlfriend who lives an hour away from me and does not drive. I can't see her more than once or twice a month at most. 

Yesterday she pointed something out to me and told me ""You should have that checked out it could be something. Related to physical medical issue that was not something that was a big deal but still something I had to deal with. I never really thought anything of it. 

So I go to the walk in clinic due to lack of a real doctor in my life and they talk for a bit and send me for tests.

Now the tests could show nothing.

The tests could show that I'm dying. (I""m not joking or pulling anything here it could be me with something that will kill me)  

I've been dealing with this for a little while but actively ignoring it cause I was scared to learn the truth. I have iatrophobia. I also have major anxiety and tend to default to the worst possible answer.

The only reasons I'm going to a doctor at all is because my Girlfriend wants me to find out.   


So on Thursday ( the soonest i can get to the tests done)  I'm going to cry like  a baby I'm going to hid in my bed and basically give in to my fear. As I have nothing at all better to do. I can't see my girlfriend till Saturday.    
  
If I tell any of my friends I know what they would say. If I tell my girlfriend I know what she would say.   
  
There is nothing anyone can do.   
  
 I don't want to be a burden to anyone. cause I know if I'm they will vanish like smoke in the wind. 

Even if the tests come back in the middle of nothing and death. I'm going to be a burden.

People will drain away from me. I'll be alone. I'm 46 and have been alone eight years. Before that almost 18, I'm not good alone. I let myself fall to bits slowly.

  
In my darkest moment's all i see is doom. It may never come to pass but that darkness scares me more than anything in the world.

1dxe903,2024-07-07T13:20:43,"About OCD(something more serious)
So I am currently 20. And I was 15 when I encountered this thing for the first time during lockdown.whenever I felt happy or at peak I don't know why but it kind of became a habit for my mind or that voice in my head to always  try to ruin it by finding something problematic deliberately or finding a problem deliberately
. I mean it just sounds insane for me that why would a person try to ruin his own happiness by finding a problem or finding a reason to deliberately ruin that particular happiness.i couldn't find a stable happiness anything that I was doing. the second I get happy LITERALLY next second it would find a reason to make me sad. I mean why would a person try to fuck with his own happiness just sounds so illogical and insane. I really want to cry but I am unable it's like that thing is controlling. I am not able to enjoy anything that I loved before. I just feel like dying and it seems like this issue can never be solved I just feel more and more hopeless. I have tried therapy and psychiatry everything,talking with friends and family but they just don't seem to understand what problem I am going through.

I can give few examples of instances when this happens
1.)I was doing very fine in studies in life in general feeling most happy in my life.i saw a news about suicide and death and suddenly my inner thing had a craving or I don't know what to call it to give me anxiety about death and infact to exaggerate it even tries to go to research about it to increase it more.i don't know if to call it sane.
2.)I used to believe in God.But out of nowhere it just gives me a reason to not believe in it though I didn't desire about.and no it's not schizophrenia that I am suffering through nor a hallucination it's simply deliberate evil overthinking what I call.
3.)Every second I find something interesting it ruins it totally kills it or ruins it within a second like its kind of a compulsion for me .I don't know what the problem with it.I am unable to control it as well.
4.) I like playing cricket and it finds a reason to convince me to not play it but inspite of the reason it gave I still like playing cricket but I don't know why somehow that reason stops me like a paradox.why can't I enjoy a single thing without it giving me a reason to ruin everything.
5.)earlier during covid at home whenever I am happy for a second,if it sees a knife it will ruin my happiness by thinking or giving me a thought of killing me with it though I am not suicidal that time.its like a machine it's finding patterns methods or reasons how can I make a happy situation unhappy or just ruin it like a MATHEMATICAL MACHINE BASED ON ALGORITHM LITERALLY.
I have tried meditation and reading religious texts but it doesn't let me apply those teachings as it thinks that this things will do good for me so it tries to find out worst path or solution to ruin it.So religion also doesn't help me.
I don't know what should I do.cant find something about this on internet as well. Day by day I just lose more and more hope.i just want to win over these thing 
I have already ruined my 5 years 
Social anxiety 
Depression
No friends
Low self confidence
I just feel totally defeated in life

So I am in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend but as of lately she hasn‚Äôt been texting back or replying to my calls for a month or two now. I am fully aware that she can be busy because she has done things like this before but it never lasts for more then 4 weeks. This gives me loads of stress and I have told her about it she‚Äôs even gotten better about it, like warning me that she can talk to me for a while or like telling me that she‚Äôs not hurt. It‚Äôs not like she doesn‚Äôt care but more like I am starting to not love her like I used to.

^ This is just a pref example of everything continue reading to get to know more.

I have personally ideals like mostly everyone else, for example you need to be mentally prepared to be in a relationship, and if you question it do you really want it. While going into this relationship I could tell that ‚ÄòK‚Äô(my gf) really wasn‚Äôt prepared to be in a relationship but she wanted to be in one, while me on the other hand didn‚Äôt know how to say no during the time but I was still happy that she asked me. I wanted to ask her out when I was for sure that she did felt the same. When our relationship became a long distance one we would talk ever other day then over time that became monthly, this hurt me as much as I don‚Äôt want to admit that her not replying to my nearly daily text. I have don‚Äôt worse things to hurt her just because I was petty and I hate that I did.

This wasn‚Äôt much of a problem for me until she started to hurt herself (!not in the suicidal way! That was more me problem!) she would stop eating for days and world be-friend people that would only make fun of her. On various occasions this led to her getting so sick that she needed to go to the hospital. That‚Äôs why I would worry if she hadn‚Äôt texted me. We did talk about this with each other and I would do my best to comfort her, even if she denies that she doesn‚Äôt need help even if she does. I was that therapist friend before we even started to have feelings, it only makes sense that I would worry knowing that she was going through a lot.

I‚Äôm not the victim I never was. I wasn‚Äôt a good girlfriend in the past and not right now either I demanded that she pay attention to me or I do something dumb like not text for a week. I‚Äôm very childish but in the way that I handle things like a kid emotionally. While she just does what ever she is told like a puppet. That is harsh but the best analogy I have right now. She‚Äôs probably just busy but it‚Äôs not like she would be dead because I have seen her online before this past month multiple times. It just makes me think that I should leave her so maybe she won‚Äôt have to deal with texting me or dealing with me anymore. 

Do I really want to break up or am I just saying that because am petty? I have so many question for myself but I can‚Äôt answer any of them. That‚Äôs why I even made this post just to ask someone else that isn‚Äôt involved in the relationship what might help me know the answer to these questions?",break long distance relationship girlfriend lately hasnt texting back replying calls month two fully aware busy done things like never lasts 4 weeks gives loads stress told shes even gotten better like warning talk like telling shes hurt like doesnt care like starting love like used pref example everything continue reading get know personally ideals like mostly everyone else example need mentally prepared relationship question really want going relationship could tell kmy gf really wasnt prepared relationship wanted one hand didnt know say time still happy asked wanted ask sure felt relationship became long distance one would talk ever day time became monthly hurt much dont want admit replying nearly daily text dont worse things hurt petty hate wasnt much problem started hurt suicidal way problem would stop eating days world befriend people would make fun various occasions led getting sick needed go hospital thats would worry hadnt texted talk would best comfort even denies doesnt need help even therapist friend even started feelings makes sense would worry knowing going lot im victim never wasnt good girlfriend past right either demanded pay attention something dumb like text week im childish way handle things like kid emotionally ever told like puppet harsh best analogy right shes probably busy like would dead seen online past month multiple times makes think leave maybe wont deal texting dealing anymore really want break saying petty many question cant answer thats even made post ask someone else isnt involved relationship might help know answer questions,2,3,0,Positive,Low,[],[]
1dmdb72,2024-06-23T05:46:19,"Seeking guidance 
Growing up, I didn‚Äôt have the best life as my parents were constantly fighting and were emotionally unavailable. I didn‚Äôt have any grown-up figure to share my feelings and thoughts with, so I suppressed a lot within. In elementary school, I was quiet and made a few friends while high school ended with me having multiple friendships. In college, I became friends with many people and didn‚Äôt stick around with a particular social group because of anxiety of someone gossiping behind my back or thinking I was weird (I would get emotional quickly, was extremely sensitive and would often speak my mind). I was quite happy, had decent friendships and near perfect grades up until the last year of college. During the last year of college, I started having a lot of social anxiety, panic attacks and disassociation from my surroundings. I had so many friends that tried to hangout with me in the beginning of my derealization stage, but I was so unaware of my surroundings that it all seemed surreal. My friends would come up to me asking me to hangout, but I was so absorbed in my phone I didn‚Äôt realize what was going on. I was sent to the ER multiple times throughout the span of a year. It was 1 year later that I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism from a previous hyperthyroidism diagnosis from my childhood. A few months later, I got an arranged marriage to a wonderful man that I started my family with. 

I moved with him to the Midwest where his family resides. For the past few years, all my time has been spent with my husband, kids and his family. Since moving to the Midwest, I have worked from home and developed some virtual friendships with co-workers which is the extent of my social circle. I have befriended a couple of ex coworkers whom I speak with over the phone a few times a month or see yearly. ¬†While I am working remotely and paying the bills, my husband takes care of the children and manages our social gatherings with his family. It wasn‚Äôt until recently that I started to rethink my whole life and realized I was in depression. I opened my old social media and saw my conversations with friends from a decade ago. I would message them multiple times in a row without hearing back for days or weeks at a time. Out of frustration, I spoke what was literally on my mind and cursed some of them out via email/text. I still have PTSD from that hurt of not hearing back from them. I spoke with my friends (argumentatively and not being able to hold back my expressions) similarly to how I would speak with my parents and siblings. 



Now thinking back on my adolescent and college years, I spent a lot of time at home on the laptop/phone without interacting with my family. I am fine while at home, but when I go outside, I develop a lot of social anxiety and cannot converse with too many people from fear of judgement or getting into an argument with someone (which people from my society usually do but I am afraid of). I have recently met some people that I hung out with a few times while sometimes I don‚Äôt receive a reciprocal response. Unfortunately, I start to get random thoughts of where these friendships will go in my head and then withdraw (keep in mind that I didn‚Äôt care to make friends again until recently).  At times, I feel like I don‚Äôt have any train of thought and need someone else to control my life (i.e. manage my social circle and tell me what to do). I have been trying to shift from just being a work from home parent to being a stay-at-home mom. I am now depressed, anxious, disassociating at times and am constantly feeling like something is wrong with me (I have randomly been snapping, crying and over thinking (I am also 6 months postpartum). I overthink how I don‚Äôt really have any friends or anyone to talk to. ¬†Is there anyone else that has been thru something similar or knows what these experiences might be called?",seeking guidance growing didnt best life parents constantly fighting emotionally unavailable didnt grownup figure share feelings thoughts suppressed lot within elementary school quiet made friends high school ended multiple friendships college became friends many people didnt stick around particular social group anxiety someone gossiping behind back thinking weird would get emotional quickly extremely sensitive would often speak mind quite happy decent friendships near perfect grades last year college last year college started lot social anxiety panic attacks disassociation surroundings many friends tried hangout beginning derealization stage unaware surroundings seemed surreal friends would come asking hangout absorbed phone didnt realize going sent er multiple times throughout span year 1 year later diagnosed hypothyroidism previous hyperthyroidism diagnosis childhood months later got arranged marriage wonderful man started family moved midwest family resides past years time spent husband kids family since moving midwest worked home developed virtual friendships coworkers extent social circle befriended couple ex coworkers speak phone times month see yearly working remotely paying bills husband takes care children manages social gatherings family wasnt recently started rethink whole life realized depression opened old social media saw conversations friends decade ago would message multiple times row without hearing back days weeks time frustration spoke literally mind cursed via emailtext still ptsd hurt hearing back spoke friends argumentatively able hold back expressions similarly would speak parents siblings thinking back adolescent college years spent lot time home laptopphone without interacting family fine home go outside develop lot social anxiety cannot converse many people fear judgement getting argument someone people society usually afraid recently met people hung times sometimes dont receive reciprocal response unfortunately start get random thoughts friendships go head withdraw keep mind didnt care make friends recently times feel like dont train thought need someone else control life ie manage social circle tell trying shift work home parent stayathome mom depressed anxious disassociating times constantly feeling like something wrong randomly snapping crying thinking also 6 months postpartum overthink dont really friends anyone talk anyone else thru something similar knows experiences might called,2,3,0,Neutral,Low,['midwest'],"[(43.411391, -106.280075)]"
1dhexts,2024-06-16T21:16:24,"Why am I perpetually ""lost""? 
I'm diagnosed with autism and ADHD. A lot of my family members have ADHD, and I've been in the autism programs in high school, I've known people with autism and ADHD in my work. 

I don't think any of them really display my symptom, at least not in the way that I do. I don't know if it's actually related to my diagnoses or if it's just something else entirely. 

I can tell that people I interact with think I'm stupid, not quite all there, they treat me like I just need some extra help. I'm bad at reading people, but I see how they interact with others and then they treat me like a child (I'm 24). I wish people would just treat me like an adult, or at least not have a tone in their voice like they're judging me. Honestly I avoid social situations, I do like people, but I'm so bad at conversion and I really don't understand social interaction in the slightest bit. I embarrass myself in public, I have social anxiety too but I've really worked on it lately. I'm finding myself avoiding social situations now just because it's really obvious I'm not quite the same as other people. 

People who get to know me seem to like me, but I still think there's an underlying feeling of incompetence people expect of me. They like that I'm funny and really creative, kind and supportive. 

I think I'm just not quite all there. I feel like *I* am, but there's a disconnect between me and the world around me. People don't see what's in my head, I think they just think I'm stupid. I try to bridge the gap but it's just, ah, difficult to say the least. 

Ditzy, clumsy, scatterbrained, forgetful, this is how people characterize me. A quick wit is something I do not possess I'm *very* slow, and I have a tendency to kinda just... peace out of a conversation, I don't mean to, it's just the few strings tethering me to the world slip and I drift away. A space cadet. 

It's like my body is in this world but my brain isn't really piloting it. Just hoping autopilot has this and praying not to crash and burn, my brain lied on its resume to be a body pilot but is severely under qualified. 

The world around me... I guess, just not entirely all there. I overlook obvious details, couldn't tell you the color of someone's shirt I was just talking to. I bump into stuff, trip over stuff, people talk to me and I have to ""boot up"" and fake my way through interactions. Poor hand-eye coordination, actually poor brain-world coordination. 

I'm just lost, stumbling around the world, kinda a failure at life and taking care of myself. It's like there's a veil over my vision, the world is ""blurry"" or ""fuzzy"" around me. 

I think I'm a full human. I feel like I am. People who get to know me seem to think I am. I'm not quick, but I'm quite intelligent and creative and I love to learn and get into deep philosophical conversations with people who can reciprocate. I make art, but I'm also always lost in daydreams. The people who get to know me really enjoy my company, but they are also aware of my shortcomings and sometimes even have to take care of me a big because they think I need the help even if I don't want it. I'm capable, I'm just a little slow. The world is moving *far* too fast. I want to walk the race, but everybody expects me to get my legs moving and they tend to shove me around a bit. I just want to enjoy a walk, and I wish people understood I'll still cross the finish line like everyone else and not judge me for it. 

Actually I hate living life, but because I think I'm trying to live it differently than the rest of society and that somehow makes me dysfunctional in the eyes of others. I do really wish I could just daydream all day and draw, but I have expectations. I'm just not going to meet them the way everyone else expects me to. I'm very under qualified for a functional participant of society. I like to think I'm normal but it becomes obvious I'm not any time I have to interact with anybody (even my confidantes) and the world.

1de0ejq,2024-06-12T08:58:42,"How do I stop pushing people away?
I've noticed I push people away, when we talk I simply stop myself from sharing too much, when people wanna get close to me I start feeling overwhelmed even if they just send one text message so I end up procrastinating on answering them and end up forgetting after some days. When I put myself in conversations with them I hold my opinions and reactions, I won't talk to keep the conversation going, simply because I end up feeling without energy to even try. When people flirt with me I shut them down, I tell them I'm not interested and if they insist I end up not responding after a few days.

If I'm lucky enough to have people interested in continuing to talk I show the worst in myself, my insecurities, my biases, my unpopular opinions, just trying to have them stop thinking highly of me.

I have a hard time trusting people and I make the effort but it's very easy to lose my trust and they notice I don't trust them enough so.. yeah.

When I get attached to people I end up being very needy and.. that pushes them away

All the time there is fear involved and I make people drift away from me.

I do all of these when I try to protect myself and a lot of the times I'm also thinking: ""I don't want you to get too close and get hurt by me"", ""I'm too toxic for anyone to get anything good out of being in my company"" ""it's better when I'm alone""

So what do I do? I'm supposed to do the opposite but it seems like it's way easier said than done, my emotions become too painful and overwhelming before I can even get close to people.",stop pushing people away ive noticed push people away talk simply stop sharing much people wanna get close start feeling overwhelmed even send one text message end procrastinating answering end forgetting days put conversations hold opinions reactions wont talk keep conversation going simply end feeling without energy even try people flirt shut tell im interested insist end responding days im lucky enough people interested continuing talk show worst insecurities biases unpopular opinions trying stop thinking highly hard time trusting people make effort easy lose trust notice dont trust enough yeah get attached people end needy pushes away time fear involved make people drift away try protect lot times im also thinking dont want get close get hurt im toxic anyone get anything good company better im alone im supposed opposite seems like way easier said done emotions become painful overwhelming even get close people,6,10,0,Neutral,Low,[],[]

Hi guys. Im 26(m) and im getting married at the end of this month. 

One thing that ive always had at the back of my mind was the fear that I would turn out just like my dad. 

I grew up with him being a drug addict and physically abusive to my mom and eventually me. I tried to step in anytime something would happen starting at around 15 y/o and it kinda went on from there. 

I was great at controlling my emotions during my teens and always felt kinda like a hero that stood up for what was right (as cringey as it was) everytime I took the beatings that my mom would have to suffer through. 

Well, recently ive noticed a change in my demeanour, which I traced back to when he died about 3-5 years ago. Ive become more irritated and highly stressed, which made me lash out at people. (Verbally not physically)

I later found out that I had GAD or anxiety for short, and to make a long story short, ive been trying to be mindful about all aspects of my life. 

As me getting married is getting so close, the fear ive had since i was a kid kinda reared its ugly head recently and I cant get over it. Im so scared that ill turn out like him at this rate.

ICE IN HER GLASS

I knew someone was going to die

All she could think about was self-harm

She poured herself a drink

She went to the barn with no hope 

Looked up at the rafter 

She couldn‚Äôt find a way to cope

She made the decision to end it all 

The anxiety too much to bear 

She grabbed the rope and took the fall 

She didn‚Äôt shed a single tear



Her decision had such an impact on the living 

We hope she found the peace she craved 

She was such a sweet person and had been so giving

1cgxggn,2024-04-30T18:43:06,"I was falsely accused of racial discrimination and now I'm petrified of leaving my home because of social media backlash.
For context,  I work third shift at a hotel. A couple nights ago I was working at the desk and somebody called to tell me that there was kids on the fourth floor making noise. I wasn't given a room number or any other information. So I knocked on a couple of rooms that I thought might be making too much noise. I informed them that I wasn't sure which room was the issue specifically, just that I wanted to let multiple people adhere to the quiet hours. The third room had a lady that proceeded to tell me that I was racially discriminating against her. It was a long ordeal of her pointing a camera phone at me, threating to call the police because I was taking to long to get her refund or in the way she wanted it, telling me she hopes I get fired and don't have a job tomorrow because shes calling corporate, that I'm being racist, that I look like I'm high because my pupils are dilated(I actually worked like 16 hours prior at different job with only three hours of sleep), and that shes going to post the video over social media and the news.

 Basically an intense situation and of course she doesn't have any evidence on camera because that's not my character. Though whatever video she has is probably my absolutely bewildered face at situation because this came out of nowhere. I had called my manager hoping that he would come in and disfuse the situation. Night shift only ever has one person staffed at a time. And last November they got rid of security. He said he couldn't come in and that I should just call the police. I felt utterly alone. Like nobody was there to diffuse the situation or stand up for me..I felt all of this forced on me. And honestly it's one of the things I've been most afraid of in customer service. Being  accused of discrimination and having my face blasted all over TiK Tok, YouTube ect. Everytime a situation at work comes up, I'm alone. And my managers always tell me to just call the police, but not every situation warrants the police. I actually think in this circumstance it would have made it worse. More content for her video or whatever.

I feel so alone and now I'm absolutely petrified to leave my house. I go into anxiety attacks to have to show my face in case she posted that video somewhere. I'm back to wearing a mask at my other job not because I'm sick but because I'm trying to hide myself. And I know that logically, I shouldn't care right? I'm not guilty of anything, but I've had prior experiences with social media and I just feel like social media assumes your guilty until proven innocent and they don't care. They just jump on whatever reactionary video and take the side of the accuser. I feel like my life is about to be ruined. And even if she never posts anything, I will always be on edge waiting for her to do so. I'm watching her media accounts everyday. I can't let it go because I don't want my life ruined.

Therapy couldn't even help me over the years, so know that it's that bad (or maybe I'm overexaggerating). I'm bad at explaining things like this in text since it feels like too much of a chore. But considering I'm contemplating suicide with my five year ldr girlfriend at the moment, that should be the least of my annoyances...

I'm living with a narcissistic mother that abused some of my health issues growing up and constantly ruins my plans of getting to my end goal of living with my girlfriend in Colombia in order to have a better life with or without her realizing it (She doesn't want me to live with my girlfriend because she has a racist notion of Colombia currently and only wants me to stay here in the United States to serve her as a maid) I can't get a job because said mother sabotages that somehow. Tried getting my passport but she's making us move when we were so close to me having us be together... We have no choice but to rely on her to get together now... 

She basically won. My girlfriend was the one to work her ass off trying to get the money for all the errands I needed to get my passport just for it to backfire with my mother leaving to North Carolina in a few weeks (I'm currently in Florida after losing all my childhood things in Boston after a failed move with my fucked up grandmother fucking me and my mother over). We were so close... 

We haven't even got to meet each other in person before for the past five years we been together. Her getting a visa is near imposible because of racist America. There's so much I have to say in so little time... I'm texting this currently as I'm having a crying nervous breakdown. Please, I'd anyone can help us with the process...

1bptmo2,2024-03-28T12:49:26,"I feel like I've lost skill and memories
I'm not sure I'm in the right place.   

Basically, I feel like things I used to be good at... I'm not  anymore. Certain creative activities, talking to people, even just  thinking. I think I used to be great at those things, but over time,  it's like I've lost skills.   

This could be due to battling an addiction, various trauma I've been through, periods of extreme stress. I don't know.   

I also feel like there are gaps in my memory. Maybe if I sat down  and really tried to remember certain things, I might get somewhere, but  ADHD makes that very difficult. Why do I feel like I'm missing chunks of  memory? And there are certain things that I REMEMBER remembering, do  you know what I mean? Like I have memory of recalling memories in  certain situations. But now I think I've lost some of those original  memories.   

I'm really praying I can get back some of what I've lost. I'm genuinely worried my brain has degraded in some way.   

I'd love to seek therapy if that were financially possible. I used  to be in therapy, but left for a multitude of reasons. But I still  support the practice.   

So what do you think? Are there any resources for someone like me?  I've meditated before, and sometimes it's helpful. But I can't seem to  find any resources for meditation (guided meditations or simply tips)  for these purposes.

Last talk, i said i was on the verge of losing my girl and well... it happened. Its been... ohhh six days or so and ive never felt more alone than i do without the promise of her embrace. 



I feel like i almost deserve this... but i know thats illogical.




I miss her so damn much. And its funny... cause i never thought i would be so attracted to her bodytype in particular... but holy hell am i ever... just because of the person its attached too.. shits been rough without her or my best friend... but at least my mom saved my life without realizing to the extent she did... 



I SH'd again... not my usual method... but the morning she said its over i found the strongest wall in the house ang banged my head on it 3 times... each time harder and harder, i actually caved in a good section of the wall the size of my forehead, and i have a bit of a scar to show for it... 



I have been more open with my mom and stepdad about my mental health though... and they are being as supportive as they can... moms helping me work out the courage to see a doctor about it... im just trying to survive.



I asked her for a second chance... we'll see what she says... but i poured my heart out in tjose texts tonight, and tried to somewhat explain why i think i even deserve one.. i just want her in my arms again. No one else fits them quite so well...



I miss her so damn much. Sure... plently of women out there... but only one of her. Only one (her name)  and the only one that i want... 


I just HEAVILY dont wanna submit to the belief that the love im after is dead. If i submit to that... i may as well be dead already. 


So yeah... theres my life atm. Also new job. Minimum wage. Yay. But its somethin..

1b1wncn,2024-02-28T05:05:43,"M20-college, this post is the most recent entry of a journal I've been keeping ever since going through some traumatic events, and thin
Hello and welcome back to the journal! Things are bad woooooooo! What's all happened so far... I met a new girl almost immediately after I started school, and we all know how that's gone. Just another why did I let myself get attached to another girl, let alone a girl like her? Aloof, impulsive, arrogant, stubborn, anti-consumer, unforgiving, nontalkative, and incomprehensible. And boy do I have a thing for girls like that. Apparently... Her name was Liv. She was all that and I still managed to become love-blind and complacent to the way she was. It's genuinely embarrassing how little self-assertion, self-preservation, and respect and care I have for my own needs, expectations, and boundaries I have around girls. All stemming back from she who broke me. My mind just puts myself aside 90% of the time, trying not to cause any dissatisfaction or disagreement. I rarely stand up for myself, speak my mind let alone act on it. I'm a meek, sheepish, compliant, sensitive hopeless romantic. And for what? Just to get left in the dust again, with all but a speck of closure, because I couldn't get the guts to get myself out irretractibly when I should have. Or not gotten involved in the first place. I hate being such a bona fide sucker. I could've just left it alone when she was buddy buddy with another kid named Aiden. But for some reason, she started letting me in. You know, little bit of flirting, wanting to see me, she even made the first kiss on me. That's how it went last time, with Y.K.W. And after a while, we were really close. I liked her sense of humor, her spontaneousness, even if I struggled to keep up most of the time, her body...god it killed my rationality, her unapologetic strangeness. All of which would come back to discourage me. It was all hunky-dory at first, it always is, but as always, I started to not be able to keep up. She stayed in her ways, and I started bending more and more to her. Losing my own sense of behavior and trying desperately to imitate her's. I can ever hold it together for long. I don't know why that is, probably for some unachievable sense of approval. But we couldn't have been more different. The things I would say to try to make her laugh, she would tell me flat out weren't funny. She would constantly object to my behavior, treat me like nothing more than an annoyance, question my thoughts like saying ""Why would you say that"" or giving me a look that said exactly the same thing, she would also constantly discourage or shoot down me just trying to make conversation, talk about my interests, anecdotes, plans, concerns, jokes, with no regard as to her impact. She was a brat, one of her favorite responses to any number of my statements was ""Ok?"" the kind of ok that bluntly tells you that person gives a perfect 0 fucks about what you just said. An opinion of absolutely pointless, insignificant, trivial, why-did-i-even-just-waste-seconds-of-my-life-recieving-that-information-from you, utter lack of impression or consideration towards the remark kind of ""ok"". And I am not one to take being utterly blown off well, especially from someone I'm that infatuated with. There were some times she made me feel so special, and cared for, and like she wanted to be a good thing in my life, but also times as the opposite. A perfect example: she would constantly gush about how much she adored me, say I deserve to be loved, and even went as far as to say that she ""more than just 'likes' me"", which you don't have to be a romance expert to know that she's saying she's falling in love with me. And even though we never dated, all that gave me the impression that I was the only one she'd want, you know in an explicitly romantic sense. And to add to all that, while we were at a Halloween event at the local club, she used the loud music to disguise openly saying that she was in love with me. I pretended like I hadn't heard her, to play along and not blow her cover, but I heard it. It made me so happy. It felt genuine and sweet and a little humorous how she had wanted to hide saying it. Nonetheless, in that moment it just felt perfect. But no good thing lasts forever, and apparently for me sometimes not even till the end of the night. In the middle of dancing together, she spotted some 250-pound, dopey-eyed, greasy bull cut incel fuck dancing in front of us. And what did she decide to do? God this hurts even to write. She slides a little closer to him which obviously gets his attention, this dude looks like he hasn't felt the touch of a female his whole life, or at least shouldn't have, and starts smiling at him, and dancing with him. Then she starts caressing his face. Then she puts his hands around her body. Then, right in front of me, she starts making out with him. Right in front of me. Like I'm not even there. The feeling you get from witnessing a heaven-sent girl that just a little bit ago ""secretely"" told you she's in love with you sucking the tongue of a college-age version of James Garretson from Tiger King is cosmically above and beyond revolting. I'll just leave that story there for the sake of not throwing up. It really is almost too much to even think about. Still, after that, I gave her another chance. It was stupid of me. It was beside myself of me. Again, I didn't have the guts to see what I should've seen and do what I should've done. It's honestly disgraceful how easy I am to walk over. I need to work on it, get better at standing up for myself and letting bad things go when I should. I'd be feeling a lot better right now if I had. Because she never really gave much in the way of an apology anyway. She barely took accountability. She's a damn selfish hypocrite too. Whenever she had an issue with me, she'd come to me and tell me she wanted to talk about it. I'd try explaining anything she wanted to her as best I could, and despite that hardly making a difference because she was impossible to be told to think about something a different way than she already did, I still tried because it was something she wanted from me. If she wanted answers, I'd try to give her them, no matter what. She did not grant me the same. It was impossible to get answers out of her on any important matter. Why she was upset, why she didn't feel good, why doesn't she take a little more consideration towards my feelings, why she started making out with a stranger and not me, why she's suddenly done with me and what's nothing to do with me. All questions I will never get a straightforward, comprehensible answer to put my mind at ease. I am a person who desperately needs answers to things I don't understand. Without them I panic, I feel trapped, like I'm purposefully being withheld information. It's ten-fold if I get the feeling it's something I did. I can't just let it go either. As much as most people don't like to cause confrontation, I welcome it. Despite that, Liv never talked. It's that feeling of you wanting the person to open up to you so bad, but they make you feel like they can't talk to you, for whatever reason. I can't stand that feeling. It makes me feel so small. To the very end, I held out a sliver of hope I'd one day get answers from her. Even when that last day came, almost a week and a half after she stopped opening my texts, I approached her as she was leaving the dining hall, I pushed through her objections of ""I have to get to class"" and tried as many different attempts to get an answer from her-if I did something wrong, what was this all about, why she didn't want to speak to me. And the biggest thing I got was ""Because you make me sad."" ""Why"" ... ""I have my reasons."" ""So do you not want to talk anymore?"" ""No."" And with closing statements that couldn't more perfectly sum up the fundamental divide between us: ""I-I don't get it."" ""Ok."" That same freezing, utterly indifferent ok. Immediately following her classical uninterested interjection, she cheerfully stated how the car driving next to us was the kind of car she would want to her friend who was awkwardly walking next to her and I. Just like our short uneventful conversation never happened. Just like I wasn't even there. And to think I actually ever believed this girl cared about me. It truly hurts, and I have such a hard time coping with these situations and emotions. Betrayal, lack of understanding, regret, wasted time, getting all worked and then let down all the same. I keep putting myself in these situations because I keep wanting to hope one of these times it'll be different, but so far every time it's ended all fucked, one way or another. And I'm still no better at knowing how to recover or deal with the aftermath. It just hurts, and it's so confusing. As I write I'm finally breaking down into tears because I'm just so at a loss for what to do or think. I've lost another person I deeply cared about, despite how they weren't the best for me. It still hurts. I've lost so many people in just the past few years. Over and over I try to make new connections, but no luck. Girlfriends, lovers, classmates, homies, suitemates, it's taking a heavy toll on me. A whole discord circle, my first true love, my next several attempts at having a relationship, my theater friends at Heartland, my friends from orientation, most of the friends I've made in the past school year, and now my second true love. I can't keep going down this road, I just can't. I'll come apart completely if I do. I don't know who to talk to, who can offer me help, what I can even attempt to do to revert from the hollow, desperate, scared shell I've become. It's never been the same since quarantine. Since that first wrong turn, I easily could have never made. But here I am. How do you learn from years of destroyed feelings and ruined connections and move on to a better path for the future...

1atd6us,2024-02-17T22:43:34,"Repressed Trauma(long but idk where else to go)
34(F) I've struggled with my mental health since as long as I can remember. I believe it began when I was molested by a friend of my mother & step father. When I reached out to a friend to explain what had happened to me, it was reported to school but not the police.. (no clue why)  I remember my mother bringing me to a therapist, but staying in the room the whole time.. I wasn't allowed to get the help I needed. My mother made me lie to the school and the therapist saying I made everything up. I did because I was afraid of her(mentally & physically abusive alcoholic) Because of all of that I am afraid to trust any professional. I still don't understand how my mother was able to manipulate everyone involved that I made it all up. I remember the smell of his shitty cologne, the coors can that was left on my dresser and having to scrub blood out of my underwear the next morning because I was afraid to tell anyone what happened. It had to have been my fault in some way (at least that's what I felt at the time.I started cutting my wrists, thighs and carving words into my legs. A few attemps of overdosing on my mothers pills. I repressed the memories of being molested and abuse from my mother. Learned to deal with my mental health(poorly)on my own without a therapist and never told another soul about what happened, not even my husband. 

Fast forward to my first pregnancy..
 I had PPD with my 1st child, but it turned into something so different for me mentally. Feeling like I was outside my body, running on auto pilot, constant need of praise or some kind of encouragement that I was worth living. I struggled to talk about any of my feelings even with my husband. HUGE MISTAKE. I wanted to pretend the thoughts weren't there, and I managed to convince myself in some ways that I was okay mentally. In the mix of all of that I let another man into my life. Not physically in anyway (HUGE issues with men putting their hands on me in anyway because of my past.), but he flirted with me at work alot, and it got to the point where I flirted back. It became an emotional affair. I remember wanting to feel desirable and appreciated. I needed an escape from my thoughts.  Never in a million years would I have thought I could do anything like that, but I did and I will never be able to forgive myself for it. I should have brought up my past with my husband at that point, at least to try to make him understand that I could never cross that line physically, but I never did. I still fucked everything up by even talking to someone else, so would it have even mattered.

Most recently my husband brought up a time where I was pregnant with our second child where I apparently got in my car, drove into the yard and said I was going to kill myself. I have literally no memory of ANY of that. My question is what type of mental illness can cause memory loss to that point. It clearly was a huge event in my life, but why can't I remember it. Hearing about this pushed me into looking for help. Is it similar to other repressed memories I have? I feel so lost and am terrified of remembering more about my past. I still haven't been able to bring myself to talk to a professional so I haven't been officially diagnosed with anything.

1ar2sgt,2024-02-15T01:42:18,"How do I convince my subconscious to calm down?
I‚Äôve never been to therapy because I cannot afford it, so I‚Äôm not sure if I have underlying mental health conditions like anxiety or depression. Tapping into the Reddit community for some suggestions.

For context, I am a 25 year old woman who grew up in a strict (southeast Asian) home. My parents have always loved my siblings and I very much, but my mum has a bad temper. She often blew hot and cold; affectionate one moment, complete psychopath the next. It is common to beat your children in Asian culture, so I‚Äôve never considered that abusive in and of itself, but she also did other things that were more questionable.

For instance she would threaten to cut off my fingers if I refused to practice the piano, she force fed me adult-portion noodles after I had complained about being hungry even though I gagged and cried, she threatened to abandon me at a mall and actually drove away momentarily to teach me a lesson about wandering off on my own (apparently I did that quite often). She was also ashamed of my academic performance as a kid. I have always been extremely insecure about my intelligence, even now.

Again, I must emphasize that I know my mum loves us, she probably used discipline tactics that she had to endure in her own childhood. But I do believe (from my own online research) that this type of upbringing probably had an impact on my ability to manage/navigate my emotions, and respond to stress in life, as an adult.

I have been told that I am a people pleaser, slightly reserved (though not always!), a little scatterbrained, non-confrontational, and extremely sensitive. I respond to stress, sadness and anger by crying. I cry very easily.

I work in B2B Sales which isn‚Äôt rocket science obviously, but still stressful especially in this economy. I try to be as productive as possible, but find myself crying almost everyday (not in front of coworkers or customers, just when I‚Äôm alone). I get super envious of peers who are achieving great things in life and often compare myself to them. I love socializing but I am often worried about saying something stupid. I also get really anxious when I feel that someone is annoyed or upset with me, even when I know it‚Äôs irrational. My conscious mind understands that everyone is unique and valuable in their own way, and other people‚Äôs opinion of me should not matter, but my subconscious has trouble fully believing it.

So, how do I convince my subconscious to calm down?

1apmwqf,2024-02-13T07:26:37,"Does anybody miss that person they ‚Äúused to be‚Äù before their depression hit?
I‚Äôve had my depression for almost 9 years (And counting), and frequently wish I could go back to who I was before the fall of 2015, which was when it first struck me. Not necessarily go back in time, but just go back to being that person I was before it hit. I was this super energetic, outgoing, active, confident person, who was always sooo happy and optimistic. I never cared about a thing people said or thought about me. I never allowed other people‚Äôs opinions or judgements bring me down. I was a thick-skinned dude, I actually enjoyed doing things such as playing video games, making movies, skating, hanging with friends, playing sports, etc. 

Now I have a very low stress/frustration tolerance, I care a lot about what other people say, im super sensitive to criticism and negative comments and emotions, super lethargic all the time, anxious, very self conscious about how I look amongst many other parts of myself. It‚Äôs honestly been so long since I‚Äôve lived without depression nor anxiety, it‚Äôs kind of hard to remember what life was like. If there‚Äôs one good thing this whole journey has done for me, it‚Äôs allowed me to really reflect on how my life has been and who I am as a person. In a way, it allows me to really think about my behavior and plan to improve in many areas where I struggled in. It has also made me into a much more compassionate and empathetic person than I used to be. While I do want to feel like I did many years ago, I do believe that I‚Äôve made a lot of change in myself and hope that I can continue to grow.

Any advice? Do people ever go back to who they were before their mental struggles arose? Or do they become better? If they never do, how do they learn to live with their depression? Is it always bad? Would I have to get ready for it? I‚Äôm also very curious about how it feels for someone to not have depression.",anybody miss person used depression hit ive depression almost 9 years counting frequently wish could go back fall 2015 first struck necessarily go back time go back person hit super energetic outgoing active confident person always sooo happy optimistic never cared thing people said thought never allowed peoples opinions judgements bring thickskinned dude actually enjoyed things playing video games making movies skating hanging friends playing sports etc low stressfrustration tolerance care lot people say im super sensitive criticism negative comments emotions super lethargic time anxious self conscious look amongst many parts honestly long since ive lived without depression anxiety kind hard remember life like theres one good thing whole journey done allowed really reflect life person way allows really think behavior plan improve many areas struggled also made much compassionate empathetic person used want feel like many years ago believe ive made lot change hope continue grow advice people ever go back mental struggles arose become better never learn live depression always bad would get ready im also curious feels someone depression,7,3,0,Positive,Low,[],[]
1ap0ppv,2024-02-12T15:03:21,"How can I help my friend who is having a mental breakdown?
As the title, basically. My (30s M) close friend (30s F) is in the middle of a mental health crisis and I have no idea how I can help. I'll give some details, explain where I'm up to, and then I'd appreciate anything and everything you might be able to offer. Thank you in advance!

So, my friend is in a very stressful job, has three children and a very unsupportive/selfish husband. Stress from her job has been building and building, and she has told me that she's nearing breaking point multiple times. She said she had a breakdown one evening last week (unspecified what exactly happened) and now needs help more than ever. She is very independent, so it feels like a lot of stuff I've read online about helping someone with their mental health doesn't seem to apply. For example, she's organised a doctor's appointment for herself and doesn't need/want someone with her there or to help her look at her options, be an advocate etc. She is also very proactive and solutions-driven, so saying things like ""I'm sorry this is so hard"" etc she finds actively unhelpful. From the outside, she looks like she's doing ok - going to work, things ticking along at home etc - but they are anything but. However, I've also offered to do things like help with childcare or housework and both of those she has turned down because it would be more hassle than help.

I'm really struggling because I find it really hard to put myself in her shoes and to understand how she feels to know what I could say/do to help. I highly suspect I'm autistic, which would have a lot to do with struggling to empathise. I'd love to hear from people  who have been in this sort of situation before to know what it felt like and what they found most helpful from others - or what they would have wanted other people to do for them! Specifically, I find it really difficult to even think of something encouraging to say which isn't twee or just empty words. For example, she told me yesterday about something frustrating her husband had done which had caused more work for her, but after giving her space to vent about him I couldn't come up with anything helpful to say. It's getting to a point now where either I become able to help her and be a positive influence in her life, or we won't be able to be friends anymore. Which I find incredibly upsetting, because I really do care for her, I just have no idea what to say/do. So I'm feeling pretty desperate right now, to be honest.

I think that's it. I'd be grateful for anything you could offer, from explaining how she might be feeling and therefore what she might find helpful to some phrases/ways of saying things that she might find encouraging.

1aor4ht,2024-02-12T05:11:11,"Anger / overstimilation management
Does anyone have any idea how to manage or have any strategies to handle anger/overstimilation? I get angry & overstimulated very easily and typically over small things. This causes a lot of family members or people that see what's on the inside to think I'm a bitch, controlling, etc. The only mental health issues I have been diagnosed with is Severe anxiety & depression. I feel like because I'm always snapping over the littlest things I've drifted really far from my family and my bf is currently at bootcamp so I just feel really alone with all this pent up emotion. I've always been very snappy, even when I was younger. I'm not expecting anything professional- just easy ways to keep my head & calm myself when overstimulated. 

Things that have overstimulated me and how often: 
‚Ä¢ Too much people talking (Nearly every day)
‚Ä¢ Someone talking too much (Nearly every day)
‚Ä¢ People getting too close to me (often)
‚Ä¢ People touching me too much (Sometimes)
‚Ä¢ Too much noise (Nearly every day)
‚Ä¢ Asking a lot of questions (Nearly every day) 
‚Ä¢ yelling or arguing (Nearly every day)
‚Ä¢ Continuing a convo after I've left it (Nearly every day)

Any strategies, techniques or suggestions are very helpful!! Questions are welcome.
